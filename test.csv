Now there are only a few thousand humans left alive that must struggle to survive under the threat of the infection. Billions of infected roam around the world in massive swarms seeking the last living human colonies. Survival Mode - Available Now! In this mode, a random world is generated with its own events, weather, geography, and infected population. You must build a successful colony that must survive for a specific period of time against the swarms of infected. It is a fast and ultra addictive game mode. We plan to release a challenge of the week where all players must play the same random map. The best scores will be published in a leaderboard. Real Time with Pause This is a real-time strategy game, but don’t get too nervous. You can pause the action to take the best strategic and tactical decisions. In Pause Mode, you can place structures to build, give orders to your army, or consult all of the game’s information. This game is all about strategy, not player performance or the player’s skill to memorize and quickly execute dozens of key commands. Pause the game and take all the time you need! Build your Colony Build dwellings and acquire food for the colonists. They will come to live and work for the colony. Collect resources from the environment using various building structures. Upgrade buildings to make them more efficient. Expand the energy distribution of the colony by placing Tesla Towers and build mills and power plants to feed the energy to your buildings. Build walls, gates, towers, and structures to watch the surroundings. Don’t let the infected take over the colony! Build an Army What kind of people would want to combat the infected? Only the maddest ones. Train and contract mercenaries to protect the colony. They demand their money and food, and you will have to listen to their awful comments, but these tormented heroes will be your best weapon to destroy the infected. Every unit is unique and has their own skills and personality – discover them! Thousands of Units on Screen Yes! They are billions! The world is full of infected creatures… they roam, smell, and listen. Every one of them has their own AI. Make noise and they will come – kill some of them to access an oil deposit and hundred of them will come to investigate. We have created our custom engine to handle hordes of thousands of the infected, up to 20,000 units in real time. Do you think your colony is safe? Wait for the swarms of thousands of infected that are roaming the world. Sometimes your colony is in their path! Prevent the Infection If just one of the infected breaks into a building, all the colonies and workers inside will become infected. The infected workers will then run rabid to infect more buildings. Infections must be eradicated from the beginning, otherwise, it will grow exponentially becoming impossible to contain. Beautiful 4K Graphics! Prepare to enjoy these ultra high definition graphics. Our artists have created tons of art pieces: Beautiful buildings with their own animations, thousands of frames of animation to get the smoothest movements and everything with a crazy Steampunk and Victorian style! Future Game Mode - Campaign In the campaign mode, you have to help the surviving humans to reconquer their country. There are dozens of missions with different goals: building colonies, tactical missions, rescue missions...

Help a small group of settlers build a home for themselves in a forgotten land. You’ll need to establish a food supply, build shelter, defend your people, monitor their moods, and find a way to grow and expand, facing challenges at every step. Starting from procedurally generated terrain with dynamic AI encounters, Stonehearth combines community management and combat with infinite building possibilities. It’s designed to be moddable at every level, from your city to the people and creatures inhabiting the world, and will ship with the tools and documentation for you to add your own customizations to the game, and share them with friends. Build and Grow Your City The heart of the game is city building and management. When you're just starting out, you'll need to juggle tasks like obtaining a sustainable food supply, building shelter, and defending your fledgling settlement from raiders and other threats. Once you've achieved a foothold in the world, it's up to you to write the destiny for your people. You have the flexibility to choose your own path in this game. Do you want to build a great conquering empire? A vibrant trade city? A spiritual monastery? We really want you to feel like this is your settlement, and give you the tools that make it look and operate exactly as you wish. Level Up Your Settlers All the settlers in your towns have jobs. A job is like a class in a role playing game. Each job has a specific role like hauling materials, building, crafting, and fighting. As your hearthlings work at a job they will gain experience and levels. Some jobs, when they meet certain prerequisites, can upgrade to entirely new jobs with new capabilities. Usually, to assign someone a new job you'll also need to craft a tool for them. The Mason can craft blocks, statues, and tools from stone, but to do it he'll need a mallet and chisel crafted by the carpenter. Our goal is to have a job tree that's both very wide and very deep, so there will be plenty of different kinds of things to do in the game, but also a lot of depth to explore if you want to concentrate on any one area. Player Driven Legacy Through Modding We LOVE mods and want to make it as easy as possible to author and share mods. Want to see a new kind of sword in the game? You can model it, define its stats, and then craft it in game. You can also share the design with other players so they can enjoy it too, or bring their authored content into your game. As a modder you’ll be able to do basically anything that we as developers can do: introduce new items and monsters, write new scripted adventures, influence the AI, you name it.

The other players are the “Experts” who must give the instructions to defuse the bomb by deciphering the information found in the Bomb Defusal Manual. But there’s a catch: the Experts can’t see the bomb, so everyone will need to talk it out – fast! Rounds are fast-paced, tense, occasionally silly, and almost always loud. Everybody has a role to play whether they are defusing the bomb or deciphering information from the manual. Puzzle solving and communication skills – and maybe a few friendships – will be put to the test as players race to defuse bombs while communicating quickly, clearly, and effectively. Features Challenging puzzles – Test the limits of your communication skills… and friendships? A different bomb every time – Procedurally generated puzzles keep the action fresh. Local multiplayer party game – Bomb defusing is a team endeavor. Going solo is not an option! Only one copy of the game needed – If you can talk to the bomb Defuser, you can be their Expert. Try using your favorite voice chat service and playing remotely. Mod support – Try new community-made modules, missions, and more from the Steam Workshop!

Now years have passed and everyone has fled east, leaving behind a ghost land. You were part of an expedition to investigate the creatures and their origin.

Now you're the sole survivor, out of supplies and clinging to what's left of your airship as it drifts down towards the sand. You've spotted some wagons in the desert ahead and have just enough fuel to make it there. You might find supplies, and if you can scavenge enough to get back into the air then you might be able to limp from location to location and rebuild enough to fly far west, solve the mystery and stop the monsters...

It is designed to perform many of the things you can do while playing at a conventional gaming table and move it online. Shop DLC in the updated Steam Store You can browse by category more easily from the SmiteWorks Publish Page link below. BROWSE DLC . A Note about DLC for Fantasy Grounds Fantasy Grounds has a wealth of DLC available as add-ons. Each of these DLC add-ons expands Fantasy Grounds to support a brand new game system or to add new adventures and supplements from your favorite game publishers and artists. SmiteWorks has negotiated license deals with several dozen different RPG Game publishers and artists, both large and small, to bring you a very large variety of gaming options. Our agreements with these publishers and artists provide royalties for every purchase made through Steam and elsewhere, so that a purchase of DLC for Fantasy Grounds is the equivalent to or better for the publisher than walking into a game store or book store and buying a physical book from the publisher. Each and every purchase is directly helping fund and grow the RPG hobby industry. The share that SmiteWorks retains for this helps pay our content and programming developers and helps us add support for more and more games. In many cases, the content you can buy as DLC can be built directly by you within Fantasy Grounds if you already own the material in another form. The DLC provides a convenient option for time-strapped gamers who also wish to directly support the gaming industry. * This is not a stand-alone game. This game features no computer controlled AI and relies upon another user acting as a Gamemaster to control the story, action and enemies you face. Overview Fantasy Grounds is a hybrid application which allows you to play and create your own RPG games. It facilitates this play and provides some optional add-on Adventure modules which can be loaded and played with very little preparation. Each game will require a GameMaster (GM) and one or more players. Games may be played in a session as short as a few hours or continued with multiple sessions over a series of days, weeks, months or years. A GM will typically install the application and choose their game-system of choice, which we refer to as a Ruleset. Fantasy Grounds comes pre-loaded with Rulesets supporting compatible play for Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2E, Dungeons & Dragons 3.5, Dungeons & Dragons 4E, Dungeons & Dragons fifth edition and the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game (R). Additional Rulesets are available for free and for purchase from our Workshop. The 3.5E, 5E and PFRPG rulesets are good places to start for new GMs and for people new to Fantasy Grounds. These Rulesets come pre-loaded with some basic Library modules full of abilities, spells, monsters and items that have been marked as Open Gaming Content (OGC) by their respective copyright holders.  The 5E ruleset contains all the content from the D&D Basic Rules for D&D fifth edition. Additional rulesets, such as that for Call of Cthulhu or Savage Worlds are fully licensed versions and contain otherwise closed and proprietary content that we've licensed from those publishers. As of April 2015, Fantasy Grounds acquired an official license from Wizards of the Coast for D&D fifth edition. This means that the 5E ruleset supports basic understanding and gameplay for D&D fifth edition but you can also buy fully preloaded data packs and adventures that are licensed from Wizards of the Coast as DLC here on Steam. Players For players, Fantasy Grounds will allow you to connect to a game being hosted by a GM and control one or more characters within the game. You will be able to update and maintain your character sheet, much like you would in a face-to-face RPG game, but with some degree of automation and support for dragging and dropping abilities and items from the Library modules (for rulesets which support them.) Whenever a GM shares a map image, you will be able to move a token representing your character and initiate attack rolls against enemies visible on those maps when it is your turn. You will be interacting within the GM's game session with other players and every action you take will be communicated to the GM and connected players along with any chat messages you enter into the chat window. At the conclusion of the GM's game session, you will log out and your character sheet and progress will be saved to the GM's session. When you meet back up and a pre-scheduled time with the GM for the next session, you will be able to continue where you left off.  Scheduling of future game sessions is handled outside of Fantasy Grounds via email communication, the Fantasy Grounds forums and Game Calendar, Steam discussions or through whatever source the GM defines.  SmiteWorks hopes to improve the match-making features at a later date. GameMasters For GameMasters, Fantasy Grounds will allow you to outline and prepare your future game sessions. You will be able to create story entries and link them together or to specific maps. You could, for instance, create a story entry which links to an image of a dungeon and then each room could in turn be linked to individual story entries -- each containing room descriptions, secret GM notes, a list of NPCs and monster encounters or links to more images and player hand-outs. Depending on your game master style and the availability of pre-entered monsters and enemies, you can also run without preparation. You can create and maintain multiple Campaigns, each with their own content and players. When you are ready to run your campaign, you will need to spend some time recruiting players and establishing your preferred frequency and length of play, methods of communication when you are not connected with Fantasy Grounds and whether or not you want to use a voice application such as Skype or Google Hangouts alongside Fantasy Grounds. Most GMs tend to use a combination of in-game text-based chat within Fantasy Grounds *and* a voice application to help facilitate quicker and more natural play. With this version of the product, you can: Run games as the Gamemaster (GM) Host games as a GM for other players and GMs who are connected as players Host a demo game for 1 player who is using only the FG Demo. The campaign won't allow saving, but will give you the ability to demonstrate the functionality to prospective players.

In an entirely frozen world, people develop steam-powered technology to oppose the overwhelming cold. You face the task of building the last city on Earth and securing the means necessary for your community to survive. Optimization and resource management often clash with empathy and thoughtful decision-making. While city and society management will consume most of the ruler’s time, at some point exploration of the outside world is necessary to understand its history and present state. What decisions will you make to ensure the survival of your society? What will you do when pushed to the limit? And who will you become in the process? MAKE THE LAW Establish laws that regulate the existence of your growing society. Decide on their working routine, healthcare, food provision and other crucial aspects of everyday life. Maintain their hope and contentment – the moral condition of your society is as important as securing the basic means to keep them fed and safe. SHAPE YOUR SOCIETY If you reach a turning point, do not hesitate to determine the path of your people. Should you rule them with an iron fist... or show them a way of compassion and faith? Reach for extremes or try to find a fair balance. Whichever you choose, remember: there’s no turning back. WEIGH UP YOUR CHOICES Some of your decisions will seem small – like deciding the fate of a troubled citizen or meeting the demands of a newborn faction – but be aware that the sum of your doings can lead to unexpected results. Your people put their faith in you, but their devotion is not limitless. Leadership can be a burden. DEVELOP NEW TECHNOLOGIES Survival demands progress. React to current events, but don’t forget about the long term and investing in development and technological progress. Providing a highly advanced infrastructure with self-powered automatons, airships, and other technical wonders is difficult, but achievable. It all depends on your management and leadership skills. EXPLORE THE FROSTLAND While New London is your main focus, there is much more to the world than what lies within the limits of your city. Expeditions, while risky, can bring you valuable intel, precious supplies and grow your society’s population. There may be people out there, and their fate lies solely in your hands. PLAY ENDLESSLY Frostpunk’s Endless Mode is the latest, longly awaited update requested by our community. It’s the biggest DLC to the game so far, offering new maps, game modes, mechanics, and it will allow you to dive into the Frostpunk experience deeper than ever before.

And every single expansion unleashes new deck-building strategies and battle tactics, and even new leader classes and game modes. We’re in this for the long haul and we hope you will be too.  - Beautiful art: All of the cards in Shadowverse feature fantastic art by some of Japan’s finest artists, and every single card is available as an animated version. Every card is also fully-voiced, in English and Japanese, as is the singleplayer storyline.  - A great community: And last but not least, we have some amazing fans. We’ve got memes, we’ve got streams, and we have much, much more to offer than the average card game.

Playable factions, cultures and kings: Thrones of Britannia will include ten playable factions, from five cultures, with a summary below. The Anglo Saxons – West Seaxe and Mierce When Roman rule in England concluded, new kingdoms of Germanic stock coalesced in the counties now known as Northumbria, Mercia, Wessex, Essex, Sussex, East Anglia and Kent. The peoples of these regions came collectively to be known as the Anglo Saxons. West Seaxe Faction Leader: King Alfred As the dominant Anglo-Saxon kingdom of southern England, the forces of West Seaxe – or Wessex in modern English – provided the isle’s primary resistance against the incursions of the Great Heathen Army. From the capital city of Winchester, Wessex conquered lands in Surrey, Sussex, Kent, Essex and even Mercia. Alfred’s dogged defense of the Danish invasion laid the foundations for Wessex to unite England under one ruler for the first time in 927 AD. Mierce Faction Leader: Ceowulf From its capital city of Tamworth, the kings of Mierce – known now as Merica - ruled the area now known as the Midlands. At its height, Mierce stretched from Northumbria in the north of England to Kent, Sussex and Wessex to the south. In 877 AD, the Great Heathen Army seized the eastern part of the kingdom to form the Danelaw, or East Engle. The Gaels – Mide and Circenn Gaelic culture initially developed in Ireland, their society built around a system of clans and chieftains. They raided and traded with Roman settlements, and by 878 AD had expanded from Ireland to inhabit much of Scotland. With the influx of the Vikings, some raiders settled in Gaelic lands, becoming the Norse-Gaels. The Scottish Gaels would absorb the Picts to become the Kingdom of Alba – essentially setting the blueprint for modern Scotland. Mide Faction Leader: King Flann Sinna Mide lies at the heart of Ireland. Not just geographically, but politically, intellectually and spiritually. Many High Kings have risen from Mide, and its current ruler, Flann Sinna, aspires to that title. With many fellow Irish factions nearby, Mide is in a position to potentially bring the disparate clans together, and usher in an era of Irish prosperity. However, threats are never far away… the Vikings of Dyflin have settled to the east, and their power and influence are growing. Will Mide strive to keep the uneasy peace? Unite the clans in a war against these Norse settlers? Or find some other route to supremacy? Circenn Faction Leader: Áed mac Cináeda Circenn was in origin Pictish, but became more heavily influenced by the Gaels and other peoples over time as they were driven away from the relentless Viking raids. 878 AD marked the end of the Viking invasions, but Circenn’s troubles were far from over. While she had a firm hold over the eastern coast of Scotland, many threats still exist – both within and without. Scoan, the capital of Circenn, was once home to the legendary Stone of Destiny, said to bestow divine strength on her people. Where the stone now resides is a mystery, but if clues can be found, surely the Stone’s recovery would be an adventure worth undertaking… The Welsh – Gwined and Strat Clut The Welsh Kingdoms descended from the Celtic Britons who occupied much of the island of Britain from the Iron Age, into and beyond its Romanisation in the First Century. Ironically, the term ‘Welsh’ derives from the Anglo-Saxon term for foreigner, ‘wealas’, which they applied to the native Britons. The Anglo-Saxons flourished and many of the old Brittonic kingdoms began to disappear. Gwined Faction Leader: King Anaraut The people of Gwined have some claim to the title of 'true Britons', having been driven to the far west by invaders who now call themselves ‘English’. Renowned both for their bardic arts and their skill with the longbow, the Welsh of Gwined thrived under the leadership of Rhodri Mawr. Rhodri kept Gwined largely free of Vikings and other invaders while expanding its borders. Now he is gone and his lands are divided. Strat Clut Faction Leader: Run Strat Clut is a kingdom of the Old North that can be traced back to the Fifth Century and the Celtic Britons. The realm was formerly based at the fortress of Alt Clut but driven out by a Viking invasion in 870. The current King Artgal was taken captive and reportedly killed in mysterious circumstances. The kingdom reformed further into the valley of the River Clyde under the leadership of his only son Run. The Great Viking Army – Northymbre and East Engle In 865 AD, Ragnar’s sons led the Great Viking Army and made landfall in East Anglia. Over the next 15 years the Vikings ranged high and low, from Wessex to The Clyde, conquering towns, claiming victories and suffering their share of defeats until the Battle of Edington in 878 AD, where its leader Guthrum met his match in the young King Alfred and his West Saxon army. Bested in the field, his forces retreated in disarray to a nearby fortress. Flush with success, Alfred’s men gave chase and laid siege. After a fortnight of starvation, the invaders surrendered. Under the terms of his capitulation, Guthrum was baptised into Christianity and he and his men were allowed to return to East Anglia and settle – provided they kept Alfred’s peace, of course. Defeated, but never humbled, the Vikings seethe with an all-consuming rage. One does not cage the wolf without consequence… Northymbre Faction Leader: Guthfrid When the Vikings arrived in Northumbria in 867 AD, they took the city of York – or Eoferwic, as was – for their stronghold. And what a bastion it was, with its formidable Roman walls still standing strong 700 years on. King Aelle of Northumbria attempted to wrest the city back from the Danes, but was captured during the attack. In retribution for Aelle’s execution of their father, the sons of Ragnar made an example of him with the horrifying Blood Eagle ritual. Northumbria remained under Viking control and, after the battle of Edington and the subsequent treaty of Wedmore, a portion of the Great Viking Army marched back to Northumbria, to settle under Alfred’s peace. East Engle Faction Leader: Guthrum Forming the bulk of Britannia’s south-easterly coast, East Engle was the staging-point of the Great Viking Army’s invasion, and the region where many of its warriors settled after the Battle of Edington. Under the rule of the Danish leader Guthrum (or Æthelstan, to use his adoptive name by Alfred) it would ultimately come to be known as the Danelaw. Yet still, some fight remains in the Danes of East Engle. One does not shed the mantle of glory and become a landsman overnight. The Viking Sea Kings – Dyflin and Sudreyar After nearly a century of escalating raids, the Vikings left an indelible stamp on Britannia, altering the course of its history forever. Not least of all culturally, as many smaller bands of Vikings had settled around the isles prior to Alfred’s defeat of the Great Viking army. These smaller factions traded an existence of ceaseless conflict for a new life in Britannia, establishing their own petty principalities, intermarrying and ultimately becoming part of the warp-and-woof of Britannic life. This mingling of cultures, so emblematic of British history, helped create the rich melting-pot of attitudes, beliefs and language that has made the isles and their people so unique. Some Vikings never truly settled however; their designs were grander, their hunger for conquest and greatness unquenched. These Sea Kings would continue their bellicose work, heedless of any decree from England’s upstart ruler… Dyflin Faction Leader: Bardr Dyflin was a major port town on the east coast of Ireland, and the site of Britannia’s largest slave market. It was a major site of Viking occupation, and was ruled until 873 by the Viking lord Imar, often associated with Ivar the Boneless, a son of the legendary Viking warlord Ragnar Lothbrok. Viking raiders had wintered there as early as 840 AD, so their association with the region had been a long one, and over time their customs began to take on a more Gaelic flavour as the slow process of integration took its course. By 878 AD however, Imar’s son Bardr was firmly established on the throne. Would this ambitious Viking ruler seek to seal a lasting peace with the surrounding Gaelic factions? Or return to the ways of Ragnar, and pursue a path of bloodshed and domination? It is hard to ignore the calling of one’s warrior-blood… Sudreyar Faction Leader: Eirik To the west of Alba lies Sudreyar, the Kingdom of the Southern Isles. Comprising the southern Hebrides, these scattered islands were sparsely populated and, bearing the full brunt of the Atlantic weather, were not lands suited to the less-hardy. Like much of Britannia, these islands saw increasing Viking contact from the 8th Century. Prior to this period they formed part of the Gaelic kingdom of Dalriada, until they fell under Viking control. Over the next century, Scandinavian occupancy took on a distinctly Gaelic flavour (and vice-versa), particularly after 872 AD when Harald Fairhair became king of Norway, and his former opponents flocked to the area. Materially poor, but offering an excellent base for those of a nautical bent, the isles of Sudreyar are a perfect staging-post for raiders and explorers.",,"Minimum:,OS:,Windows 7 64Bit,Processor:,Intel® Core™ 2 Duo 3.0Ghz,Memory:,5 GB RAM,Graphics:,NVIDIA GTX 460 1GB | AMD Radeon HD 5770 1GB | Intel HD4000 @720p,Storage:,30 GB available space,Minimum:,OS:,Ubuntu 18.04,Processor:,Intel Core i3-2100 or AMD equivalent,Memory:,8 GB RAM,Graphics:,2GB AMD R9 285 (GCN 3rd Gen and above), 2GB Nvidia GTX 680 or better,Storage:,15 GB available space,Additional Notes:,* Requires Vulkan,* AMD graphics cards require Mesa 18.0.0 or later (Mesa 18.0.4 is recommended),* AMD GCN 1st and 2nd generation cards are not supported,*  Nvidia graphics cards require driver version 390.59 or later","Recommended:,OS:,Windows 7 / 8 (8.1)/ 10 64Bit,Processor:,Intel® Core™ i5-4570 3.20GHz,Memory:,8 GB RAM,Graphics:,NVIDIA GeForce GTX 770 4GB | AMD Radeon R9 290X 4GB @1080p,Storage:,30 GB available space,Recommended:,OS:,Ubuntu 18.04,Processor:,Intel Core i7-3770K,Memory:,8 GB RAM,Graphics:,4GB AMD RX 480 or 4GB Nvidia GTX 970,Storage:,15 GB available space,Additional Notes:,* Requires Vulkan,* AMD graphics cards require Mesa 18.0.0 or later (Mesa 18.0.4 is recommended),* AMD GCN 1st and 2nd generation cards are not supported,*  Nvidia graphics cards require driver version 390.59 or later",$39.99,

Grab unsuspecting guards to use as weapons and shields in this completely original idea set to an interpretive chiptune jazz drummer soundtrack.  Please, Ape Out was my father’s name. Shootyboots It’s the never-ending story of a young boy falling down a well, wearing a giant boot as if it was overalls, which also is a gun.  Collect gems, squash and shoot the fauna, fall deeper into the infinite well, and wear some other equally large and ballistically designed shoes.

You fight two rounds.  The winner is absolved of the obligation to ever have to fight again, but probably will anyway because the one true resolve of the flesh is a fist colliding with it.

Each character in the game is fully voice-acted, and did we mention, hot?  House Party is a brilliant 3D game with sexy models and its fair share of witty, sarcastic humor.  A robust AI allows the characters to respond to a multitude of stimuli and choices you throw at them.  This game is going to keep you on your toes with multiple story-paths and different outcomes based on the choices you make.

Build powerful ships, mighty space stations and vast planetary settlements to explore, conquer or exploit a variety of different planets and discover the mysteries of Empyrion! Fight human, alien and biological hazards and survive in a hostile galaxy full of hidden dangers. Play as a lone wolf or team-up with your friends, build new friendships, create alliances or make war to conquer the solar system. Empyrion uniquely combines elements from space simulations, construction games, survival games and ego-shooters. In Empyrion, you can forge your destiny in a galaxy with infinite possibilities! Space and Planet Exploration: An absolute free-roaming experience awaits you: warp between planets, fly from planet to moons, land on planets and freely walk around to explore your surroundings. Discover the secrets of different alien races and tangle with the native fauna and flora. A sandbox full of different, vivid planets is waiting for you to explore! Solar System and Open World: The solar system is procedurally generated and features several planets and interesting POIs. Each planet has its own characteristics (planet type, gravity, atmosphere, number of moons, terrain, surface, vegetation, climate, and resources). Building and Construction: Build large capital vessels, small fighters or mighty space stations and vast planetary settlements by yourself - or download a blueprint from the Steam Workshop and customize it with your very own ideas of form and function! Survival Mode: Get out of your escape pod, grab what's left from your ship and prepare to survive in a hostile environment. Food and oxygen are rare, resources are scarce, ammo is low and dangers lurk around each and every corner. Keep your eyes open. You need to be smart and well prepared if you want to survive more than a day on an alien planet far away from Earth. Creative Mode: Just build and make your craziest dreams come true, without having to bother with food, resources or enemies. Join the Creative Community and upload your creations to the Steam Workshop! Singleplayer and Multiplayer Play as a lone wolf in single player or join the multiplayer community: team-up with your friends, build new friendships, create alliances or make war. You can build yourself a comfortable home in a well-protected PvE area or face the permanent dangers of PvP planets to ransack their riches or conquer the solar system with your faction. Wildlife and Enemies: Don't get mislead by the peaceful animal wildlife of some planets and the silence in space. Most of the animal wildlife wants to snack on your leg - and aggressive robot drones, alien soldiers and their guardians will try to hunt you down as soon as you are within sight. Fight for your life and deploy a range of weapons against fierce and obscure alien creatures. Mining and Resource Gathering: For building and construction, you need to gather and mine resources. Dig down to the rich deposits of a planet or drill through an asteroid full of rare ore. You might also plunder alien buildings or scrap any structure you come across. Extensive Crafting System: Learn how to combine resources and building materials to craft your equipment. Craft your stuff in your base or while you are on the move and equip your buildings and vessels with a range of different devices, weapons and gadgets for different purposes. Hunting, Farming and Food System: Grow your own vegetables and fruits or hunt creatures for their meat to prepare yourself a delicious meal. Some plants help to create medical supplies while others can be picked up and consumed for first aid or to quickly settle your empty stomach. Experience and Tech Tree: Do whatever you want - and gain experience points for doing so! Scrap that old stuff and use the points to unlock those shiny new devices in the Techtree. Terrain Deformation: Each planet features a voxel-based terrain. You can entirely modify and deform the terrain: flatten it for your planetary station, dig holes to find resources or build a tunnel system to protect yourself. Empyrion is a true sandbox game!

Build and manage a Maximum Security Prison. As the sun casts it’s early morning rays on a beautiful patch of countryside the clock starts ticking. You’ve got to crack on and build a holding cell to detain the job­ lot of maximum security prisoners that are trundling to your future prison on their yellow bus. As your workmen lay the last brick you don’t have a moment to let them rest as they need to get started on the first proper cell block so you can make room for the next prisoner intake. Once they’ve all got a place to lay their weary heads the fun can really start. You’ll need a canteen, infirmary and a guard room, oh, and don’t forget to plumb in a toilet, or things will get messy, but what about a workout area? Or solitary confinement cells? Or an execution chamber? Inspired by Dungeon Keeper, Dwarf Fortress and Theme Hospital and with over 1 million players having spent time inside, Prison Architect is the world’s best lock-­em-­up. Story Mode Prison Architect opens with the story of Edward, a man facing the electric chair for committing a crime of passion.  This is followed by four additional chapters focusing on different characters and aspects of prison life.  From Mafia Dons to power-crazed senators, Prison Architect has them all! To bring these characters to life, Introversion teamed up with award winning professional writer Chris Hastings, producing an enthralling tale of corruption and human misery set against the background of the modern prison industrial complex. Escape Mode Finished your supermax? Got guard dogs roving every corridor and prisoners eating out of your hand? Now you can live the horror by firing up escape mode and play as a prisoner hell-bent on getting the hell out of dodge. Dig a tunnel, go for the armoury or start a riot and slip out in the chaos, it’s entirely up to you!

Build, harvest, and take resources from an environment where your every action affects the world around you. An imminent meteor strike threatens global destruction.  Can you save the world without destroying it in the process? Construct buildings and towns, tend to your farm, hunt wildlife, build infrastructure and transportation, craft clothing, build power plants, and research new technologies. Specialize in a craft and trade your goods to other players. Develop your civilization and sculpt your planet. As your civilization grows, you’ll need to analyze data from the simulation; evaluating the impact you have on your world.  Use this data as evidence in proposed laws, restricting harmful activities without disrupting the advancement of technology. Balance your individual needs with the needs of community, all while maintaining the state of the ecosystem. The future of your world is in your hands. Every organism in Eco exists as part of a detailed simulation; a disruption in one species can have cascading effects across the planet. Chop down all the trees, and habitats for creatures will be destroyed. Pollute the rivers with mining waste, and your farms will become poisoned and die. The ecosystem supplies the resources you and your community will need to stop the meteor.  Manage your pollution, mining waste, hunting, and resource collection to balance your effect on this system. Eco is built on a rich ecological simulation. All the data generated from the interaction of plants, animals, climate, and players can be searched and analyzed using in-game graphs and heat-maps. Use the collected information as scientific evidence support to proposed laws.  The ability to successfully debate using scientific evidence is your greatest weapon against the destruction of your world. Establish and maintain your own set of laws and government, which are enforced automatically by the game. Draft a proposal to limit clear-cutting in a protected forest, incentivize green energy solutions over fossil fuels by providing tax subsidies and penalties. Participate in elections for world leadership, allowing you to set tax rates and allocate community money.  Use a programmable law system to make dynamic and flexible rules for the community, passing them by vote.   Construct a wide variety of governments; from tightly-regulated dictator-states, to tax-and-spend subsidy programs, or even lawless communities relying on trust. Your skills increase based on your food and shelter. By consuming a highly nutritious variety of food and building an elaborate home you will rapidly increase your skill points. Skill points can be spent on skills like farming, hunting, trade, engineering, research, and more. Contribute to the greater good while increasing your own personal success. In the player-run economy, you achieve the most when you specialize and trade both goods and services. Create stores to buy and sell goods you need asynchronously with other players. Setup contracts within the game’s quest-like labor market, soliciting other players to perform specialized work for you in exchange for payment. Build complex crafting machines and charge a fee for players to use them. A thriving economy in Eco can be both a powerful tool for progress, or a dangerous threat to the environment. To grease the wheels of commerce, you can create your own currencies, backed by fiat or by resources.  Manage the value of your currency relative to others by setting exchange rates at asynchronous currency exchanges. Sell items at stores and collect credit from other players.  Eco is designed for rich asynchronous play, allowing many players of many disciplines to contribute to one another’s goals at separate or simultaneous times. All of the world’s resources originate from its environment, which is affected by your actions.  While a meteor looms over head —  set to strike the planet in thirty days — a more subtle threat grows from player-interaction with the environment.  Without careful attention, ecological destruction can destroy civilization before the meteor even strikes.  To ultimately succeed, you and your community will need to use the tools of government and economy to find a balance between progress and protection. Included Features Online Multiplayer - Collaborate online with a community of players. Local Singleplayer - Build your own world, with the option to invite friends. Dedicated Server Included - Host your own Eco worlds. Over 30 different craft tables, with hundreds of recipes. Hundreds of items, skills, craft tables, and building blocks. A simulated ecosystem with dozens of unique species. With limited carrying capacity, players must create vehicles and networks of roads to transport materials. Create your own backed or fiat currencies, using them as a means of exchange in the economy. Build stores where you can sell your excess items for a profit. Eat varied and nutritious food and build ever larger homes to increase your skills. Create contracts for jobs that you would like players with different skill-specialties to accomplish for you.  Take on contracts from other players that need the skills you possess. Design laws using programmable template system to protect your world or increase your profits, enforced by the game if ratified by the population. Run for election and make decisions that affect the globe. View and compile rich data from the simulation and use it to argue for group decisions. Claim land as your own property, and share access rights. Give and remove reputation from other players. Find a balance between progress and protection, between individual needs and those of the group, succeeding or failing together.

Steal in free roam sandbox neighborhoods. Observe your target and gather information that will help you with the burglary. Take the challenge and rob the best secured houses. Buy some hi-tech burglar equipment and learn new thief tricks. Sell stolen goods to the passers. Do anything that a real thief does! A good thief always observes his target. What's inside? Who lives there? What's your target day schedule? Find out when the house is empty and does it have nosy neighbours. Choose from lots of possible approaches to prepare the best plan. Many modern devices available in Thief Simulator might come in handy with gathering intel about your target and it's neighbourhood. The faster, the better. Find and steal as many valuables as possible in the shortest time possible. Remember that infinite backpacks don't exist. When it's about time you have to maintain cold blood. In every house you'll find tons of useless stuff, which can really slow you down. If you're not sure that you can take some serious money for it, maybe a good idea would be to leave it behind and save space for some expensive goods. If you fill your backpack with worthless items, you may have to waste your time to throw stuff out just to make space for other things. Be careful, cause some things can draw police attention to you! A real, experienced thief can spot places where there's most probability of finding some valuables on the fly. Use the flashlight at night to highlight all the valuables in sight and places where you can expect them to be. Disassemble a stolen car and sell parts on the internet. Prepare phones and tablets before selling them in a pawn shop by removing their security. Look around for any useful items. They will save you some time on lockpicking or hacking. Key near a window or purchase receipts in trash bins. All those things can make life of an aspiring thief so much easier and reduce your burglary time even by a half. Of course many of them are just useless trash... Or maybe they aren't? Be careful! In some houses you can meet unexpected guests. If they catch you in the act, they will call the police. In this case hide and wait till they stop looking for you or you can always leave the loot and run away as fast as possible.

Dual-stage triggers With a satisfying digital click at the end of the trigger pull, dual-stage triggers can be used as analog, digital, or both types of input at the same time.

Build up a hospital from nothing to a masterpiece as you design the most beautiful – or functional – healthcare operation in the whole of Two Point County. Optimise your hospital design to increase patient (and cash) flow, arranging corridors, rooms and waiting areas to your exact specifications. Expand your hospital to multiple buildings as you look to get as many patients through the door as possible. Place decorative and functional items around your hospital to improve its prestige, lower patient boredom, increase happiness and keep those end of year awards flowing in. Cure unusual illnesses Don’t expect Two Point County to be populated with your usual types of patients. In this world, you’ll experience all kinds of unusual illnesses; from Light-headedness to Cubism – each requiring their very own special type of treatment machine. Diagnose illnesses, build the right rooms to handle them, hire the right staff, and then get ready, because curing just one of these illnesses is just the beginning. You can handle a single patient – but can you handle a Pandemic? Once you’ve conquered an illness, research improved cures and machines and turn your hospital into an unstoppable healthcare juggernaut. Improve and expand your hospital horizons! Your first hospital is where it begins, but what next? Once you’ve cured the residents of a small harbour village, can you take on a bigger challenge in a busier hospital? Improve your facilities, upgrade machines, staff and layouts to make more money, more quickly. Train and improve your staff, levelling them up with new skills and abilities to make your hospital even more efficient. Make use of the extensive statistic and information screens to analyse your strengths and weaknesses, and make rapid alterations. Adjust the price of your treatments, keep an eye on your turnover, take out loans and optimise your earnings. You’ll be managing staff with unique personality types and traits, so you’ll need to keep an eye on who’s being efficient – and who is just a pain in the neck. Balance your workforce with your ambitions as you strive to make profit (and hopefully save some people along the way).

Guide a fledgling civilization through the obstacles of life. From humble beginnings, watch as they evolve and advance throughout the ages under your wing. Influence their decisions and punish the unfaithful with a wide range of godly abilities. Interact with objects, create disasters, and launch clueless creatures into orbit. This is your world, and nothing can stop you from having fun. Our goal is to bring back the features you know and love from classic god games and spice them up with fresh ideas, a modern physics engine, and stylized visuals developed by a few of our very own industry heroes. THE STORY OF A SPECIES Meet the Nuggets, a fragile and whacky species that relies on your leadership to build, research, and advance. Help them, and they will soon begin writing their own history in the stars. Every Nugget is a unique individual with a distinct set of characteristics. Just like any other living creature, Nuggets must have access to a few vital resources in order to survive. This includes water to drink, food to eat, and recreational activities to increase their happiness and quality of life. Recreational activities may include blowing stuff up. You’ve been warned. As you spend time with the Nuggets, You will see that they behave like natural, living beings. They have their own thoughts and needs - and they even have the ability to make their own decisions at times. We want to give you a feeling that you’re interacting with a living organism, almost like you’re messing around with a rather chaotic ant farm. ORGANIC GAMEPLAY Planets in The Universim aren’t just made up of a bunch of neatly-arranged objects; everything is linked together and plays a unique role in each planet’s ecosystem. Every tree your civilization cuts down, every resource they mine and every animal they hunt will affect the world they’re living in. A lack of trees and high levels of pollution will raise the global temperature over time, while reckless hunting or fishing might cause the extinction of some species. It’s your mission to manage how the Nuggets collect and utilize resources. What mark will you leave on the ecosystems that existed millions of years before your arrival? Will you use every available resource and expand at an unprecedented pace, or will you methodically create a more sustainable way of life for your civilization? These are living, breathing worlds where everything is interconnected. We aim to provide you with an unique experience unlike any of the god games you have played before. Every decision you or your civilization makes will have consequences. NATURE AS YOU KNOW IT In The Universim, nature is just as wonderful and unpredictable as ever. Every planet comes with a few surprises that are sure to challenge your civilization. From tornadoes that consume everything in their path, to thunderous earthquakes that threaten to split your civilization in two. If you treat nature poorly, it might just show you how brutal and unforgiving it can be. Each planet you encounter will have a unique underbelly. Some planets are tranquil and filled to the brim with resources, while others are barren and dangerous. Be careful out there! Something as simple as the cycle between night and day can play an important role. Wild animal attacks are more common at night, as are frequent temperature drops. Daytime offers a little more safety from the harshness of the world. With the inclusion of a full, four-season cycle, a planet’s biomes can change drastically, making it extremely difficult for Nuggets to survive brutal winters without proper preparation ahead of time.

This new season moves the contest from the rugged, enclosed indoor arenas to the lush forests, rolling fields, and rugged terrains of TEC1’’s own private SCUM Island. Both fan favorites and new prisoners will clash in a ruthless war of survival while battling for the support of viewers, producers, and corporate sponsors for fame, gifts, and a chance of life after death. SCUM aims to evolve the multiplayer open world survival game with unprecedented levels of character customization, control and progression, where knowledge and skills are the ultimate weapons for long-term survival. Combining the methodical planning and management of hardcore survival with optional PvP ‘network events’ available to everyone at anytime, SCUM strikes a unique balance between complex simulation and intense action in the next generation of survival game. SCUM is built with Unreal Engine 4 and will expand throughout the Early Access period. Fans can follow details on development with weekly dev blogs on scumgame.com and on Twitter @SCUMgame. FEATURES [ALPHA] Complex Simulation: SCUM utilizes dozens of complex systems to allow players to go as deep as they choose into the management of their character. Players can delve into the minutia of the survival experience through systems controlling their character’s metabolism, inertia during movement, and even how fast layers of clothing dry on and off the body. The devil is in the details... Massive Landscape: Traverse and explore 144 sq km of terrain that includes dense forests, picturesque beaches, serene fields, abandoned towns, and rundown airfields. Initially, the massive terrain will be handled by foot and as development continues vehicles will be introduced for quicker movement. PvP Network Events: Enter TEC1’s ongoing network events with a click of a button and be whisked to enclosed areas of the island for white-knuckle PvP gameplay. Volunteer for an event and be pitted against other prisoners with fame points and high value loot on the line for those that survive. Expanding Gameplay: While the current version of SCUM already includes basic crafting, combat, and customization systems, the featureset and gameplay will continually expand to include more advanced mechanics, more variety in gameplay, and a metanarrative for players to complete missions with hopes of one day getting off the island... Online Multiplayer: Survive with up to 64 players per server with the option to rent your own server right from the in-game menu.

Town of Salem is a fresh innovation on the classic party games Mafia and Werewolf. It is a game of murder, accusations, deceit and mob hysteria. How To Play  The game ranges from 7 to 15 players. These players are randomly divided into alignments - Town, Mafia, Serial Killers, Arsonists and Neutrals. If you are a Town member (the good guys) you must track down the Mafia and other villains before they kill you. The catch? You don't know who is a Town member and who is a villain. If you are an evil role, such as a Serial Killer, you secretly murder town members in the veil of night and try to avoid getting caught. Roles Town of Salem has 33 unique roles ensuring a different experience each time you play. Before a game starts, players are put into a lobby where the host can select what roles will be in the game. Players are then assigned roles at random from the list of chosen roles. Players have an in-game role card that explains their role's abilities and alignments. For an in-depth look at the abilities of each role please visit: www.blankmediagames.com/roles Game Phases Night The night phase is when most roles use their abilities. For example, Serial Killers stealthily murder people, Doctors heal people who are attacked, and Sheriffs interrogate people for suspicious activity. Day The day phase allows the Town members to discuss who they suspect of being an evil role. Once the voting phase starts a majority vote from the town will put someone on trial. Defense The defense phase is when you plead your innocence to the town. Have a convincing story or find yourself facing the gallows! Judgement During this phase the town will vote on the fate of the defendant. Players can vote guilty, innocent or abstain. If there are more guilty votes than innocent votes the defendant is sentenced to death by hanging! Customization Players are able to choose their own map (town setting), character, pet, lobby icon, death animation, house and a custom name. The other players in the game will see your selections. There are currently 10 maps, 29 characters, 20 pets, 5 death animations and 20 houses to choose from. Achievements There are currently over 220 unique achievements in the game. Earning achievements will grant various in-game items (however the items for donation rewards are exclusive to Kickstarter).",,,,$4.99,$9.98

From the TrueSight™ system that emulates the units’ line of sight to the cover-system that encourages clever unit placement – not to mention the combined arms approach and the hard and soft counters gameplay that will make you think twice before trying to destroy a tank with a simple squad of riflemen – each game presents players with an uninterrupted stream of meaningful tactical choices that can turn the tide of war. PICK YOUR FIGHT NB: multiplayer standalones allow you to play on any map against anyone owning any COH2 product.

Empires and their soldiers battle in an all-out planetary war on a scale never before seen, in stunning, breathtaking detail. PlanetSide 2 battles persist and the war never ends, offering constant challenges of individual skill, team grit, and empire-wide coordination. Take up arms and drop into intense infantry, vehicle, and air combat. Players come together in enormous battles across four massive continents to win control of critical territories, gaining key resources for their empire. With an extensive skill tree and class-based system, players can customize their soldier, weapons, and vehicles to match their playstyle and meet the needs of their squads, outfits, and empires. In the world of PlanetSide 2, every soldier makes a difference.   THREE WARRING EMPIRES: Players will choose to align with one of three empires: the militaristic, authoritarian Terran Republic; the rebellious, freedom-fighting New Conglomerate; or the technocratic, alien-influenced Vanu Sovereignty. Each empire has access to empire-specific weapons, attachments, vehicles, abilities, and more.  MASSIVE WARFARE: Battles take place not between dozens of soldiers, but between hundreds. They fight on foot. They pile into vehicles. They take to the skies in devastating aircraft. Each battleground holds valuable resources and strategic positions, and the empire that can conquer and hold these territories will be rewarded with the resources and the means to achieve victory.  ENORMOUS MAPS: PlanetSide 2 features four incredible and diverse continent maps with dozens of square kilometers of seamless gameplay space, every inch of which is hand-crafted and contestable. Whether in open fields, barren desert, in armed and armored bases, or in the skies, victory will rely on knowing your surroundings.  PERSISTENCE THAT PAYS: In PlanetSide 2 the war isn’t won by a single base capture. The core gameplay of PlanetSide 2 is about holding crucial territories and controlling resources. Working strategically as a team to secure tactical positions has long-lasting effects that can shift the tide of battle.  CLASS-BASED COMBAT: Players can build their soldier to match wants and their allies' needs. Six distinct classes provide a wealth of squad options and combat tactics. Grow your soldier over time as you master each combat role, weapon, and vehicle, laterally unlocking hundreds of weapons, attachments, gear, skills, vehicles, and more. Heavy Assault: Rush into the battle guns blazing. You are the dedicated foot soldier of Auraxis. Light Assault: Go where the Heavies can’t with your short-burst jetpack. Pick a high spot, throw a grenade, and out maneuver your foes! Combat Medic: Keep your fellow soldiers alive and in fighting shape. You are the beating heart of any squad. Infiltrator: Stay silent. Stay invisible. You are death from the shadows, whether with a knife from behind or a single shot from a sniper's nest. You are the enemy's constant fear. Engineer: Deploy crucial equipment. Resupply your allies. Fix the thing, then fix it again. You keep the machines running, the tanks firing, and the war effort moving forward. MAX: Step into your Mechanized Assault Exo-Suit (MAX). Cannons for hands, armor for flesh, and a disposition to match, you are a walking mass of nigh unstoppable death.  OUTFIT TEAMWORK: Join or form your own Outfit, a like-minded group of soldiers who train together day in and day out. Whether a small rapid response team or a massive clan, Outfits are vital to each empire's strategic organization.  VEHICLES & WEAPONS: Train and equip your solider how you want, with a huge array of weapons and vehicles which can be extensively customized by preference or purpose, using attachments, upgrades, and add-ons earned in the war.

No game has come closer to the replication of the Age of Sail sailing mechanics and combat. Here is what you can expect: Beautiful ships – We have been painstakingly recreating the beautiful ships of the Age of sail period. Accurate hull models, sail plans, guns, internal upgrades, historical speed trials were used in the creation of vessels. The game features 50+ ships from small cutters to large 100+ gun 1st rates allowing the player to experience every possible role of that era. Conquest and PVP Activities Fight on War Server – Fight for the domination of the West Indies, recreated based on 18th Century maps and navigational charts. Build ships, trade, attack enemies of your nation almost everywhere and capture their ships. Open trading outposts and levy taxes in the ports governed by your clan. Invest to turn your controlled ports into industrial hubs, shipbuilding arsenals or fortified harbours. Invite other clans of your nation into your alliance. Built for PVP Age of sail combat is a personal affair with no dirty tricks, corner camping, or hiding in bushes: you see the enemy from 20km and so do they. Just like in boxing you have to get close; and use all your tactical knowledge of wind, your ship to slug it out face to face. Broadside weight matters, but even a smaller vessel can overcome the superior enemy by focusing on the enemy weak spots.  Absolutely no hackers. Hacking is a killer of fun in PVP games. From the start we have build the tech around one main goal - complete elimination of hacking from PVP. We are very proud to say that we have succeeded. Naval Action is one of the few games where hacking is made impossible by design. Every battle action is calculated on the servers, even water and wave shapes. Yes - you have heard it right: there is a special server that calculates and replicates waves to all users in battle. When fighting in Naval action you can be sure you are only facing skills and ship fittings. Other activities Relax on Peace Server - All nations are at peace and players cannot attack each other in Peace servers. There are no port battles and conquest, piracy or privateering. All ships can be captured from the NPCs. Peace servers are perfect for friendly peaceful gameplay.  Trading and privateering – Buy trading goods at low prices, haul them to distant places for high profits. Board ships and sell them and their cargo at nearby ports. Use shallow waters at your advantage to escape from larger ships.  Admiralty missions – Accomplish missions for your Admiralty to earn doubloons, combat medals and reward chests. Deliver cargo or passengers, hunt specific ships, join patrol zones battles and sink as many ships as you can. Tutorials – In-game tutorials and exams help you to grasp the basics and the subtleties of gunnery and maneuvering. Passing the final naval combat exam grants you the rank of Master and Commander, together with a frigate and other rewards to start your adventures in the West Indies. Features Realistic sailing – Advanced wind and physics model provides for realistic portrayal of ship’s performance in the age of sail. Yard angles, ship angle to wind, fittings and ship condition affects speeds and turning rates. Correct tacking, boxhauling, clubhauling and other elements of realistic sailing will help you win battles in most adverse conditions.  Gunnery and weapons –  Major types of naval artillery are implemented: from long guns to mortars to carronades and obusiers. Fort and land batteries will provide you with support during battles near shores. Mortar vessels can destroy fortifications, though they may require an escort. Each gun has realistic ballistics and penetration performance based on historical gun charts and admiralty tests.. Heel and wind affects the shooting distance and will require a change in tactics.  Damage model – Every cannonball is tracked in the air and after it hits the target. Leaks, structural damage, torn sails, demasting, raking, fires, explosions and all other hazards that were possible in that era. Damage is positional: hit the gun and you might destroy it. Gunnery crews are placed deck by deck. Shot can pass through the balcony, ricochet of the gun, hit a crew member and then fly out of the gunport splashing into the water. Armor thickness and wood types affect strength of the hull and cannonballs will ricochet from the hulls at extreme angles.  Customization – Choose economy and battle perks as you progress through higher ranks. Loot or craft the shipbuilding woods that fit the characteristics you want to give to your future ship. Find knowledge books in enemy vessels and build upgrades to improve the performance of your ship.",,"Minimum:,OS:,64 bit Windows 7 and above,Processor:,Intel Core i5-4570 3.2 GHz or AMD Phenom(tm) II X4 B60 3.3 GHz,Memory:,4 GB RAM,Graphics:,GeForce GTX 460 1GB or AMD Radeon HD 6850 1GB (must support shader 5 model),DirectX:,Version 11,Network:,Broadband Internet connection,Storage:,2 GB available space,Additional Notes:,32bit OS versions is not supported","Recommended:,OS:,64 bit Windows 7 and above,Processor:,Intel Core i7-3770 3.4 GHz or AMD FX-9370 4.4 GHz,Memory:,8 GB RAM,Graphics:,GeForce GTX 660 2GB or AMD Radeon HD 7850 2GB (must support shader 5 model),DirectX:,Version 11,Network:,Broadband Internet connection,Storage:,2 GB available space,Additional Notes:,32bit OS versions is not supported",$39.99,

Unlock more Champions and gear to add to your party in limited-time events.

A Note About Premium Purchases: You can download and play Idle Champions of the Forgotten Realms for free, however, some premium in-game items can be purchased for real money. Gems earned for free in-game by killing bosses and completing adventures can be redeemed for Silver Chests and Gold Chests that contain equipment, potions, contracts, and gold. Gold chests can be purchased for real money if you do not want to wait and save up gems for them. Silver Chests contain three cards of Common to Rare rarity. Silver Chests have a chance of dropping Rare equipment cards, but do not contain Epic equipment cards. 1 Gold Chests contain five cards of Uncommon to Epic rarity. Gold Chests always contain at least one Rare equipment card and have a chance of dropping Epic equipment cards. 2 Basic Silver and Gold Chests can drop equipment for all basic non-event Champions, including Hitch and Drizzt. They will not drop equipment for event Champions (for example Gromma, Krond, or Barrowin). Event and Promo Chests function the same as basic Silver and Gold Chests, however, they only drop equipment cards for specific Champions. Check the description in the in-game Shop to determine whose items they can drop. Guaranteed “Shiny” equipment cards are available as a reward for real money purchases, however, they also have a small chance of appearing in any Silver Chests or Gold Chests that you purchase for free. 3 Bonus “Golden Epic” equipment cards are generally only available as a purchase bonus for real money transactions, however, specific Golden Epic cards may become available through free means at Codename Entertainment's discretion. In-game purchases range from $2.99-$59.99 USD (or equivalent local currency) per item. 1 Chance of a Rare equipment card in a Silver Chest is approximately 3.2%. 2 Chance of a Rare equipment card in a Gold Chest is 100%. Chance of an Epic equipment card in a Gold Chest is approximately 12%. To mitigate bad luck, a system exists to guarantee at least one Epic equipment card within every 10 Gold Chests. 3 Chance of a Shiny equipment card in a Silver or Gold Chest is approximately 0.1% per equipment card.",,,,Free to Play,

Explore vast landscapes of dense forest and open plains, traverse treacherous mountains and wade through dark swamps where horrors lurk. Hidden within are ruins that hold insight as to what came before. Through it all, keep in mind there is only one goal: survive. There is little in the way of hand holding or ulterior precepts to alter play styles or purpose. It's kill or be killed. In the end, the only one you can trust is yourself. Over the course of development the islands and their inhabitants will radically change, ever-evolving as players themselves learn how to flourish and thrive. Your mistakes will be punished. Expect no survivors. Massive Prehistoric Multiplayer Become the beast within. When joining The Isle, you can play as one of dozens of unique creatures, from tiny darting herbivores like Dryosaurus to blood-thirsty giants such as T. Rex or Allosaurus (with many more still to come!) As a dinosaur, you'll be the epitome of majestic, cunning and ferocious. Use your natural abilities and senses to stay off the menu and grow into a stronger, more capable creature. Engage with a living prehistoric ecosystem as you become either predator or prey on servers featuring up to 100+ players, all of them as hungry and dangerous as you. Form packs/herds, create nests, defend your offspring, hunt, and claim territory. A single mistake can spell your demise. Survival or Sandbox? The Isle's core game mode is Survival, a tense and difficult experience where you need to grow fast or die young. Dinosaurs in Survival mode progress through several life stages, starting out small and vulnerable. Use your scent ability, night vision and wits to survive long enough to grow, becoming more powerful and unlock new abilities such as nesting. Because of the time needed to develop a full character life cycle, not every creature is or will be playable in Survival, though more will be added in future updates. However, sometimes you don't want to struggle to survive, or you don't have the time to go through a dinosaur's whole life story. And that's okay. For players who want a less intense experience, Sandbox mode lets you play an expanded roster of dinosaurs (and soon humans!). You can jump right in as an adult super predator or a peaceful giant, with no major penalties or consequences from dying. We won't judge. A Global Community Story The Isle features a narrative told strictly through the environment, achievable only through immense cooperation among players. Are you stranded? Can you just leave? What is AE? How did the dinosaurs get here? What is the distant call that pierces the night? It will take the entire community to answer these mysteries and unravel the purpose to their being on The Isle, and each discovery will directly affect the future of the game's storyline. Future Development Goals We realize that there is a long road ahead, and a lot of work to be done to turn this into the game we want it to be. Throughout development, we will be adding a lot more to The Isle and incorporating user feedback in how we evolve the experience. Some of our planned features include: Playable aquatic and aerial creatures Even more playable dinosaurs with complete life cycles Two new playable factions: modern humans & the indigenous Evolve into advanced ""strain"" versions of certain dinosaurs Realistic dinosaur AI that uses complex behaviours Additional world biome types such as thick jungles Dynamic aerial drop-in spawn system Global in-game world quest Localization of all in-game menus & text Better accessibility & customization options Steam Achievements, Trading Cards, Emotes Mod support using Steam Workshop All that and more are on our radar going forward. We started with a plan of just a mere handful of playable carnivores, but based on player demand we expanded our scope, increased that number greatly and introduced herbivorous dinosaurs as well. Listening to our community has been instrumental in guiding our process and helped to correct our mistakes, and we hope that together we can transform The Isle into the ultimate dinosaur game. --AE Core TX Received-- --End Promotional Protocol-- --SiGnaL InTeRrUpt-- -tHEeNdISnevErTheENDisNeVeRtHeEnDIsNev -",,"Minimum:,Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system,OS:,Windows 7 64-bit or later (64 Bit ONLY),Processor:,Quad-core Intel or AMD processor, 3.0 GHz or faster.,Memory:,8 GB RAM,Graphics:,NVIDIA GeForce GTX 960 or AMD Radeon R9 280X series card or higher.,DirectX:,Version 11,Network:,Broadband Internet connection,Storage:,25 GB available space,Additional Notes:,This game needs a dedicated graphics card to run.

Equip your army with over 240 pieces of equipment, either purchased, gathered from fallen enemies or created from crafting. Centuries ago, a brutal beast of destruction rent the world asunder. In this time of need, the first Immortals came into their uncanny powers, powers so great that they succeeded in destroying the beast ravaging the land, where all else had failed. To prevent such destruction from ever happening again, the Immortals banded together to form a Council that would enforce order and stability on a global scale, stepping in at any hint of war or chaos. The Immortals might be vastly powerful, but they are few. Even they can't oversee all of the lands. This is why they rely upon their mortal agents, the Arbiters, to guard the land's people from the more day-to-day dangers they face. Arbiters range over the land, rooting out bandits, unruly monsters, and crooked officials; their word is law. But one Arbiter uncovers the deepening corruption pervading her own order, and it falls to her to halt the spread of a threat as dire as the brutal beast of yore. Strongly influenced by games such as Final Fantasy Tactics (original and Advance versions) and Tactics Ogre, this tactical RPG stands on its own as a worthy successor of those classics, bringing a slew of improvements and additions to the tactics genre.",,"Minimum:,OS:,Windows 7 SP1+,Processor:,1.2 Ghz, Pentium 4+,Memory:,3 GB RAM,Graphics:,DirectX 9.0c compatible with 512 MB,DirectX:,Version 9.0c,Storage:,2 GB available space","Recommended:,OS:,Windows 7/8.1/10,Processor:,2+ Ghz,Memory:,4 GB RAM,Graphics:,DirectX 9.0c compatible with 1024MB,DirectX:,Version 9.0c,Storage:,2 GB available space",$29.99,

Atmosphere: Leap through an intriguing world and meet curious characters along your way.

Every mechanic within the game is driven by user-defined profiles - Weapons, characters, abilities, bots, how bots dodge, how bots aim, challenges, and more are all configurable by hundreds of variables. All of these profiles can be saved and distributed in a single scenario file. Hone your muscle memory in the trainer, apply it in game. Game features: Play scenarios directly from the Steam workshop (30+ before release, 850+ a year later) to jump right in and practice your FPS skills Highly responsive input from a tweaked Unreal Engine 4 that has the approval of many top Quake players and Overwatch grand masters who have tested and provided feedback over the last year All the configuration options you'd expect of a competitive FPS (FOV, separate horizontal/vertical mouse sensitivity, unlocked frame rate, per-weapon config settings, custom crosshairs, and much more) Create your own weapons Create your own characters Create bots Tell the bots how to dodge Tell the bots how to aim Make challenges to practice specific scenarios similar to your favorite FPS All profiles can be edited in-game or with text editors. Upload your own creations to the Steam workshop for others to practice. Compete on the Leaderboards for any and every scenario on the Steam workshop. (global or friends only) Custom maps (note FPSAimTrainer does not include a map editor, but rather reads Reflex's map format thanks to the wonderful developers at TurboPixelStudio. Reflex is available on Steam now and includes a fully featured map editor as well as awesome Arena FPS gameplay) Custom crosshairs (JPG, PNG, BMP, etc.) Visual customizations (Floors/wall textures from a large list; bodies and heads of characters can be set to RGB values, differentiated by team; attacks can be set to the colors of characters) Mouse sensitivity scaled to popular games including Quake/Source, Overwatch, Paladins, Rainbow Six Siege, Battalion 1944, and Reflex. Singleplayer only. Sorry, multiplayer is too much for this solo developer. More profile related features and abilities are planned to allow players to emulate features from even more FPS games, but the existing options are extremely flexible as is. As the developer, I consider FPS Aim Trainer a tool that I will be using well into the future. My goal is to keep it relevant to gamers as long as I can. Among my top priorities: advanced movement mechanics such as bunnyhopping and strafe jumping, graph/histogram to look at your scores and accuracies over time, bot types of player-recorded paths, and simulated network lag. Running Unreal Engine 4, all graphical options that affect framerate or input lag have been disabled by default. Literally every console command was investigated to see whether any more performance could be eeked out of the engine, because you can never have enough frames per second when you are training for competitive FPSs. As such, the graphics of the game at release will not improve, although things like more options for weapon models and floor/wall textures are planned down the line.",,"Minimum:,Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system,OS:,Windows 7 or later,Processor:,Quad-core Intel or AMD processor, 2.5 GHz or faster,Memory:,4 GB RAM,Graphics:,NVIDIA GeForce 470 GTX or AMD Radeon 6870 HD series card or higher,Storage:,700 MB available space","Recommended:,Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system,OS:,Windows 7 or later,Processor:,2nd Generation Intel Core series (Sandy Bridge) or higher.

Still with the authentic look and feel and realistic weapon handling that the series is known for. Continuing the Tripwire tradition of providing strong support for games post-launch, Vietnam has already been updated multiple times, providing the player with: 64-player battles 6 different armies to play, each with their own weapons and abilities: United States Army and Marine Corps North Vietnamese Army (PAVN) and National Liberation Front (Viet Cong) Australian Army Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) Over 50 weapons, covering everything from rifles and pistols to flamethrowers and rocket launchers 4 flyable helicopters - Huey, Cobra, Loach and Bushranger Asymmetric warfare - VC traps and tunnels vs. US napalm and choppers More than 20 maps 3 distinct game-modes Proximity VOIP And hundreds of character customization options. Rising Storm 2: Vietnam offers intense action for up to 64 players in battles between the forces of South Vietnam (the US and their Allies) and those of the North - the regular, main-force units of North Vietnamese Army, plus the guerilla fighters of the National Liberation Front (or Viet Cong). SOUTHERN FORCES - US, Australian and ARVN The Southern forces have firepower and mobility on their side, with each army having its own unique supporting arms: US Army/Marine Corps - airburst artillery, the Spooky gunship and napalm strikes Australian Army - Pair of Canberra bombers and heavy artillery ARVN - medium mortar barrage and napalm strikes from older A-1 Skyraiders For mobility, they have access to full helicopter support: UH-1 “Huey”: provides rapid transport for a squad across the map OH-6 “Loach”: acts as both a spotter and airborne command post, as well as a fast gunship, with its miniguns AH-1G “Cobra”: heavily-armed gunship with massive firepower for a pilot and weapons officer Australian “Bushranger”: a Huey, with dual M60 machine guns, minigun and rockets Tactically, the Southern squad leaders become important - so long as the squad leader is alive and in a smart location, the rest of his squad can spawn in on his location. So keep your squad leaders alive at critical moments! As for weapons, the Southern forces had a wide range of the best weaponry of Western nations, ranging from older, WWII-era leftovers, through to the latest technology of the time: M1 Garand, M2 Carbine, M3 “grease gun”, BAR and M1919 .30-cal LMG M14 Battle Rifle, M40 and XM21 sniper rifles M60 LMG and M16 automatic rifle For heavier support - the M79 grenade launcher and M9A1-7 flamethrower Explosives - M61 frag grenade, M8 smoke, C4 explosives and M18 Claymore NORTHERN FORCES - NVA and VC The Northern forces offer a broader mix , with the People’s Army of Vietnam (PAVN - or NVA) as the regular, disciplined and better-equipped main fighting force, in comparison to the National Liberation Front (NLF) guerrilla fighters, equipped with whatever weaponry was passed down the chain to them from Russia and China - known as the Viet Cong. For supporting weapons each has: PAVN/NVA - heavy artillery, surface-to-air missile defenses and rapid reinforcement from the Ho Chi Minh trail NLF/VC - a mix of ordnances (mortars, rockets, white phosphorous) used in a heavy barrage To compete with the Southern forces’ mobility, the Northern forces have their own mobility - and stealth: NVA and VC squad leaders can place spawn tunnels widely across the maps, allowing themselves and their squads to spawn much closer to the action - or even behind the lines Given their “home field advantage”, any NVA or VC crouching or prone in cover can’t be spotted by Southern helicopters or aircraft SA-2 Missiles - the quick way to counter Southern air assets is by calling on surface-to-air missiles, if the commander can time it right “Ho Chi Minh Trail” ability - the NVA/VC commander can activate this ability to accelerate his team’s spawning rate, when times get desperate “Ambush Spawn” ability - the NVA/VC commander can also cause anyone on his team who is waiting, to spawn on his location for potentially devastating ambushes. The weaponry for the Northern forces is wide-ranging - the PAVN well-equipped with modern weapons delivered from Russia and China, while the VC have to work with a wide variety of weapons: AK-47 and Type 56 Assault rifles Russian SKS-45 and US M1 Carbines and Mosin Nagant 91/30 rifle MN 91/30 and SVD sniper rifles PPSh-41 and French MAT-49 SMGs IZh-58 double-barrelled shotgun DP-28 and RPD LMGs RPG-7 rocket launcher MD-82 toe-popper mines, Tripwires and Punji traps "," Mature Content Description  The developers describe the content like this:  This Game may contain content not appropriate for all ages, or may not be appropriate for viewing at work: Frequent Violence or Gore, General Mature Content  ","Minimum:,Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system,OS:,Windows 7 SP1, Windows 8.1, Windows 10 (64-bit versions only),Processor:,Intel Core i3 @ 2.5GHz or AMD Phenom @ 2.5GHz,Memory:,4 GB RAM,Graphics:,NVIDIA GeForce GTX 460 or ATI Radeon HD 5850,DirectX:,Version 11,Network:,Broadband Internet connection,Storage:,60 GB available space,Additional Notes:,UNSUPPORTED HARDWARE: 32-bit Operating Systems","Recommended:,Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system,OS:,Windows 7 SP1, Windows 8.1, Windows 10 (64-bit versions only),Processor:,Intel Core i5 @ 3.2GHz or AMD @ 4.0GHz or better,Memory:,6 GB RAM,Graphics:,NVIDIA GeForce GTX 760 or AMD R9 270X or better,DirectX:,Version 11,Network:,Broadband Internet connection,Storage:,60 GB available space",$24.99,$216.31

The story brings the player to a dystopian United States in the not too distant future where physics-based interaction combined with hyper realistic weapon handling and stunning graphics will make you feel like you’re physically part of the action. Fight either alone, or with your friends throughout the whole campaign, which is fully playable in Co-Op. Action-oriented story, gripping gunfights, realistic weapons with an on-the-fly swappable attachment system. Immersion like you’ve never felt before in a VR military shooter! Available for Arcades on SpringboardVR HYPER REALISTIC COMBAT SYSTEM - USE YOUR BODY TO FIGHT AND FIND COVER Handle, aim and reload your weapons with real-life movements! We modeled the in-game weapons based on their real-life counterparts paying extreme attention to detail. Each weapon has its unique reloading method that you have to learn and practice to fully master them. If you fancy explosions, just grab a grenade and throw it at the enemy. After you pulled the pin of course. Stay in the open for too long and you’re dead. Try to find cover instead, duck, crouch, sneak, peek around a corner, clear obstacles with real-life movements. Military combat isn’t all about shooting. Being aware of your surroundings, the terrain, and working together with your squadmates are all part of a successful mission. Don’t let your fellow soldiers down! REALISTIC WEAPONS - CUSTOMIZE YOUR FAVOURITE GUN Everyone has a unique playstyle. Is accuracy your thing? Put a laser sight on your assault rifle and take accurate shots in semi-automatic mode, or just grab a sniper rifle. Are you more of a shoot first, ask later type of person? Take a shotgun, or dual wield your machine guns in fully automatic firing mode. Be careful though, recoil can make your job really difficult! Combine your favourite gun with your favourite attachments on-the-fly to find out which variation suits you the most! THE STORY - DIVE INTO AN ENGAGING DYSTOPIAN ADVENTURE IN THE NOT TOO DISTANT FUTURE  Water is life. Someone should’ve made that clear before humanity started poisoning Earth with microplastics. Now water is death. People are fighting for drinkable water, for survival. The military tried their best to keep order, but inevitably they got overwhelmed. That’s when mercenaries appeared.. then entire private armies.. and then when hope started to fade away came the religious cults. The most fearsome of all is a secretive organization worshipping Tlaloc, the aztec God of rain. The “Tlalokii”, as they call themselves. Their motto? “Join us or perish”. What is even worse, they know something that can change the fate of humanity. Be part of this action-packed, story-driven VR adventure where you fight alongside your fellow soldiers trying to keep order… or what’s left of it anyway. STUNNING GRAPHICS We place realism above anything else. Graphics and ambiance are crucial parts of this, that’s why we took extreme care in audio and visual design.

Strong teamplay, national armed forces, real locations, full body awareness and a versatile customization system all contribute to the authenticity of the modern combat experience enhanced by other essential elements such as a robust ballistic system, advanced armors and life-like weapons. Produced in cooperation with military R&D centers and consultants, World War 3 shows the consequences of every battle in the context of a global war campaign on a strategic war map. KEY FEATURES: Modern Battlefield Experience World War 3 presents a modern conflict with tactics, techniques and procedures inspired by true combat engagements. All of this packed into two exciting game modes. Warzone offers opportunities for dynamic, intense firefights in teamwork-focused battles of infantry and armored units over fortified points. The tactically-oriented Recon allows players to cooperate within small reconnaissance squads left on their own to survive and capture high-value targets in hostile territory. Together these modes create a coherent gameplay experience aimed at presenting the actual feel of modern warfare. Real Life Locations We are proud to give you one of the most realistic levels in the history of FPS. Join the battle on the streets of Warsaw, Berlin and Moscow. Take advantage of the urban environment to surprise enemy forces and dominate the battlefield. Versatile Customization Find your own unique combat set fitted to your needs and style without being bound by classes or roles. Choose from hundreds of combinations of unique weapon parts, attachments, skins, camos and paints. Same rules apply to vehicles, tactical gear and uniforms. If it’s possible in real life, it’s possible in World War 3 - simple as that! National Pride World War 3 is heavily grounded in military realism, offering accurate depictions of weapons, uniforms and equipment of national armed forces. All of it to inspire you to make the war effort personal and prove that your country is the dominant force on the battlefield. All maps are based on real-life locations such as the streets of Warsaw, Berlin and Moscow (more locations planned) recreated with an unprecedented attention to detail. Strong Teamplay World War 3 supports team-based gameplay rewarding the initiative in playing as a part of a squad. Responsible cooperation within a squad is the best recipe for combat effectiveness. Players can choose between assuming the role of an Attacker or a Defender, and use any gear available to support their playstyle – what matters is the victory. Armor vs Projectile The most authentic bullet vs. armor system in the FPS genre to date, achieved through years of research and development with military professionals. Ballistics, a weight system, full body awareness, vehicle physics, and an extensive customization system all affect the gameplay in a meaningful way. Strategic War Map To show consequences of every battle, player performance is rewarded with resources used to conquer or defend a territory. Gain additional bonuses via the metagame and turn the tide of war! Every destroyed vehicle, every kill, every bullet fired, every achievement affects the big picture presented on a constantly evolving, interactive war map eventually covering the entire planet. Community Driven Development World War 3 is being developed by competitive gamers who grew up playing FPS games. As an indie studio we strongly believe that community input is crucial in creating enjoyable and memorable games.

Dawn of Man is a survival/city-builder from the creators of Planetbase . The game starts in the Stone Age , and takes you up to the Iron Age , spanning more than 10,000 years of human prehistory. You will have to get your people to survive, expand and evolve, just like our ancestors, facing the challenges that the environment will throw at you. Hunt Animals were a vital source of food and resources for ancient humans. Use their meat to feed your people and their skin and bones to make clothing and craft the tools you will need to stay alive. Confront Mammoths , Woolly Rhinos , Ancient Bison , Megaloceros , Cave Lions and other species that roamed the earth at the time. Gather Collect a variety resources from the environment: fruit, berries, water, wood, flint, stone, ores. Use them to prepare food, to make tools and to build structures in your settlement. Plan for harsh times Fish is more abundant in spring, berries and fruit can be collected in summer and animals are easier to come by when it's warm. When winter comes, make sure to have enough non-perishable food and warm clothing in order to survive. Expand and fortify your settlement Build more homes and facilities for your people, in order to expand your population. Construct fortifications and craft weapons, so you are ready for when the inevitable conflict comes. Research Technologies Each new discovery will make it easier for your settlement to be able to support larger populations, but will also bring new challenges: increased food demand, morale issues and more frequent raider attacks. Build Megalithic Structures Our ancestors were capable of incredible engineering feats: mine massive rocks from the environment, transport them using sledges and construct colossal stone structures. Control Nature Unlock farming technologies to grow your own vegetables, so you can feed large amounts of people. Domesticate animals to produce food, resources and provide increased muscle power.

Your kingdom must survive a living and dangerous world. Do the viking raiders make off with your villagers? Or are they stopped, full of arrows, at the castle gates? Does a dragon torch your granary, your people dying of starvation in the winter, or are you able to turn the beast back? The success of your kingdom depends solely on your skill as a city and castle planner. Strategically layout your town to improve your peasants' happiness and to attract new residents. Tax them just enough to fund your castle. Make sure your peasants are fed in the winter and healed of plagues. Build churches to keep them from despair and taverns to keep them happy. You can even throw festivals if you've built a town square! Send out wood cutters to collect wood, set up stone quarries to build your castles, and farm the land efficiently so your town can grow and thrive. The new land you're settling is at risk of viking invasion. These raiders seek to kidnap and kill your peasants, steal your resources, and burn your town to the ground. Use a powerful castle building system where castles are constructed using blocks which can be placed anywhere. Towers and walls are dynamically created based on how you stack and arrange them. Archer towers and other weapon emplacements have longer range the higher their tower. Try different layouts to best protect your kingdom and express your glory as a king or queen. And it all takes place in a beautiful dynamic world with a stylized procedural cloud system and season cycle from summer to winter.  A realistic tree growth algorithm simulates the forests. Depending on your needs, wood cutters can clear cut or responsibly manage your forests. Kingdoms and Castles is the first Fig funded game to be released.

Strengthen the pillars of a new regime, or search for more power at the top of the new order! Choices matter –  make world-altering decisions with far-reaching consequence: As a Fatebinder in the Overlord’s army you wield a vast amount of power in the occupied lands of the Tiers. Will you use that to inspire stability and loyalty, or will you try and offer a better way?

Earth has changed. Twenty years have passed since world leaders offered an unconditional surrender to alien forces. XCOM , the planet’s last line of defense, was left decimated and scattered. Now, in XCOM 2 , the aliens rule Earth, building shining cities that promise a brilliant future for humanity on the surface, while concealing a sinister agenda and eliminating all who dissent from their new order. Only those who live at the edges of the world have a margin of freedom. Here, a force gathers once again to stand up for humanity. Always on the run, and facing impossible odds, the remnant XCOM forces must find a way to ignite a global resistance, and eliminate the alien threat once and for all. XCOM ON THE RUN: Take command of the Avenger, an alien supply craft converted to XCOM’s mobile headquarters. New open-ended gameplay lets you decide where to guide your strike team, how to grow popular support, and when to combat enemy counter-operations. RECRUIT RESISTANCE FIGHTERS: Five soldier classes, each with its own skill tree, let you create specific soldiers for your tactical plan. TACTICAL GUERRILLA COMBAT: New gameplay systems offer more tactical flexibility in combat. Use concealment to ambush enemy patrols. Loot enemies for precious gear and artifacts. Rescue VIPs and save fallen comrades by carrying them to the extraction point. A NEW BREED OF ENEMY: A diverse cast of enemies from powerful new alien species to the ADVENT, enforcers of the alien regime, offer a distinct tactical challenge. RESEARCH, DEVELOP AND UPGRADE: Configure and build rooms on the Avenger to give XCOM new capabilities on the battlefield. Use your Scientists and Engineers to research, develop and upgrade weapons and armor to fit your preferred tactics. EACH MISSION IS A UNIQUE CHALLENGE: Go on missions around the world, from wildlands to the heart of the alien-controlled megacities, to the depths of alien installations. There are virtually infinite combinations of maps, missions and goals.

Guide colonists through the perils of subterranean asteroid living and watch as their population grows until they're not simply surviving, but thriving... Just make sure you don't forget to breathe. Build Extensive Bases and Discover What it Takes to Survive: Everything in your space colony is under your control, from excavation and resource allocation right down to plumbing and power systems. Resources will begin depleting with your first breath, however, so be sure to dig fast if you want to live. It’s Mind Over Matter with Stress Simulations: Keep the psychological impact of survival at bay with fun leisure activities, great accommodations and even better food for your colony. Duplicants each have different and potentially destructive ways of reacting to stress, so be sure to always keep them happy. Whatever the cost. Avoid Boiling with Thermodynamics: Temperature control is a constant concern in space; too cold and you'll freeze, too hot and you'll fry. Keep tabs on ambient environmental temperatures and your colony's heat production to maintain a nice, cozy atmosphere for your colonists.

Plan well and be rewarded as your colony transforms into an imperishable, well-oiled machine. Take Charge with Power Grid Simulations Choose from a multitude of power sources including coal, hydrogen, natural gas or just plain old elbow grease.

Always Keep Yourself Breathing: Enter the Oxygen Overlay and watch air moving through your base in real time. Monitor carbon dioxide accumulation and oversee oxygen generation processes to mold your colony into a veritable deep-space oasis. Waste Nothing through Extreme Recycling Make use of every last resource for a base that truly exemplifies efficiency. Recycle waste into precious fuel, process unbreathable gas into air or harness the natural bodily processes of wild creatures for food.

Our soft-body physics engine simulates every component of a vehicle in real time, resulting in realistic, dynamic behavior. The driving feel is authentic and visceral, and crashes are realistic and violent; yet the physics are accessible enough to drive with a keyboard or gamepad while still being authentic with a full racing wheel with uncompromising realism. Environments and vehicles in BeamNG. drive are hand-crafted with passionate attention to detail. With years of meticulous design, research, and experience, we authentically recreate the feeling and excitement of real world driving. We are a small team from around the world with no obligations to publishers or outside interests. Our users and modding community are our first priority. Help us make BeamNG. drive the ultimate driving experience and discover what an open and uncompromising soft-body vehicle simulator can be. Why is BeamNG. drive the game for you? As an open world vehicle simulator, BeamNG. drive will cover a large array of vehicular disciplines - everything from a delivery mission in a box truck to a high speed rally race or a destruction derby. The vehicle customization and detail will allow you to make your car or truck all your own - fix it up, upgrade it, or strip away body panels to reduce weight. There are a lot of different types of gameplay we want to implement beyond just racing and crashing, such as police chases, stunt challenges, and other specialized minigames. Eventually we would like to have some kind of single player open world career mode, with persistent vehicle ownership and procedurally generated used vehicles to buy and events to run them in. In some ways, BeamNG. drive is about doing anything you want with a car or truck - the stuff other games don't let you do. You can go off-roading in a family sedan or hurl a delivery truck around a racing circuit, all with beautiful soft-body simulation physics. You can mod those same vehicles to be racing beasts, derby monsters, or off-road behemoths - or just thrash them stock. At the end of the day, BeamNG. drive gives you the gameplay you want, and doesn't force you to do anything that you don't think is fun or interesting. The future of the game and our physics engine As we optimize our game and computer technology improves, the amount of vehicles which can be simultaneously simulated at a smooth framerate will increase. Right now you can run 4 to 6 cars at one time on a high end quad-core processor. Each vehicle has around 400 nodes and 4000 beams, all being simulated 2000 times per second. We hope to expand the number of simultaneous vehicles possible to at least 8 with a mid-range processor. We will also look towards having multiplayer in the future, but it may be some time before we can create the multiplayer experience everyone is expecting. We are well aware of the demand for multiplayer and we want it just as much as you, but for the short term we are focusing on the single player career mode, various driving events, fixing bugs, and creating more content. It is feasible that we could implement local and/or same PC multiplayer in the interim. Also, the possibilities extend beyond land vehicles. Users in our community have already made planes and helicopters that fly purely with the existing vehicle aerodynamic physics, with no cheating whatsoever. BeamNG can simulate aircraft in a very authentic way due to its soft-body physics.

We aim to bring our expertise in real time soft-body physics and soft-body physics model design to the forefront of game physics simulation, making available the technology and know-how to as a wide an audience as possible. To achieve this, we are designing the engine and corresponding assets, so as to be independent of the underlying game engine and operating system. Right now the physics engine is running on a multicore CPU configuration, but we are also in the process of supporting GPUs via OpenCL. Our mission To have realistic, accurate, destructible, and malleable physics everywhere. To make anything possible.

The Imperator Augustus Campaign Pack is set in 42 BC during the chaotic aftermath of Caesar’s grisly murder. The republic remains whole, but its soul is divided as three great men, the members of the Second Triumvirate, hold the future of Rome in the palms of their hands. Octavian, Caesar’s adoptive son and the heir to his legacy. Marc Antony, Caesar’s loyal friend and most trusted lieutenant. Lepidus, Pontifex Maximus of Rome and the man who secured Caesar’s dictatorship. With the territories of The Republic divided between them and the military might of Rome at their beck-and-call, the members of The Second Triumvirate are each in a position to make a bid for leadership, and rule Rome as its first – and only – emperor. However, external forces are on the move, looking to exploit the instability of Rome and expand their own territories. Will you fight as a defender of Rome and defeat the other members of the Triumvirate? Or lead another faction on a campaign of conquest and expansion, and take advantage of the chaos as the Roman civil war rages?

Purchase and upgrade your own buildings to use as safe fortified havens when things go bad, or use them to start up a business. Aid or oppose the various factions in the world while striving for the strength and wealth necessary to simply survive in the harsh desert. Train your men up from puny victims to master warriors. Carry your wounded squad mates to safety and get them all home alive. Features Freeform gameplay in a seamless game world in the largest single-player RPG world since Daggerfall, stretching over 870 square kilometers. The game will never seek to limit you or restrict your personal play style. Custom design as many characters as you want and build up a whole squad to fight for you. Characters will grow and become stronger with experience, not just in their stats but their appearance too. Original take on the RTS-RPG hybrid genre. No ""hero"" characters with artificially stronger stats than everybody else- Every character and NPC you meet is potentially an equal, and has a name, a life. You are not the chosen one. You're not great and powerful. You don't have more 'hitpoints' than everyone else. You are not the center of the universe, and you are not special. Unless you work for it. Build a base where you can research new technologies, upgrade your defences and craft new gear. Purchase and upgrade your own buildings to use as safe fortified havens when things go bad, or use them to start up a business. Variation and possibilities of gameplay. Be good, be evil, be a businessman, be a thief, live in a town, live in the desert, travel alone, travel in hordes, build a fortress, raze a city. Devote yourself to freeing slaves, or maybe end up a slave yourself. Dynamic, ever changing world. Support or hinder whoever you wish, or keep to yourself, the world won't stop moving. This is not just a ""game"", you are living and surviving in a simulated world. Get captured by cannibals and eaten alive , or sold off by slavers and forced to work in the mines. These are not scripted events, just a regular part of this chaotic world that ruins your life by chance. Anything can happen, yet anything can be overcome if you have the strength. Absolutely no Level-scaling. The world does not level up along with you, and the shops don't change their inventory to only items matching your level. At the start of the game almost everyone will be stronger than you, and survival will always be a struggle. The game won't hold your hand or help you when you're down. Realistic medical system that affects gameplay. A character with a wounded leg will limp or crawl and slow the party down, wounded arms means you must use your sword one-handed or not at all. Severe injuries will result in amputees needing robotic limb replacements. Blood loss means you can pass out, and the blood will attract predators. A character’s stats are affected by equipment, encumbrance, blood loss, injuries and starvation. Intelligent AI that allows for characters to reason and work towards long-term goals and desires. Squads work together and carry their wounded to safety. Characters can be setup to take care of micromanagement for you and run production in your base. Aid or oppose the various factions in the world while striving for the strength and wealth necessary to simply survive in the harsh environment. Independently developed with no design influences, or alterations dictated by men in gray suits who have never played a game before in their lives. Original game world.

CROSSOUT - The Road to Apocalypse In 2027 a mysterious viral epidemic known as the ‘Crossout’ swept the planet, countries and populations simultaneously began to fall at an alarming rate all over the Earth. Those who did not die in the first few days, were plagued by hallucinations and headaches, many people went mad, others and committed suicide. The source of the disease could not be detected but the cities that were once the vibrant social and economic beacons of humanity were left ravaged and deserted. Survivors gradually began to change — after fifteen years of transformation, the changes became visible. The most noticeable metamorphosis occurred in the eyes of the affected — some began to glow, while others resembled black holes. To hide their unnatural looks and conceal the mutation, people started wearing padded clothing and sunglasses. Twenty years have passed after ‘Crossout’. Humans still remember their life before the disaster. As always, there are groups trying to recover the old world, while others enjoy the chaos and destruction. But there are those who are not human any more. They hide their faces behind masks, and their motives are unknown.",,"Minimum:,OS:,Windows® 7 / Windows® 8 / Windows® 10,Processor:,Intel® Core™ 2 Duo E8500 or AMD Phenom™ II X3 720,Memory:,4 GB RAM,Graphics:,NVIDIA® GeForce® GT 440 or AMD™ Radeon™ HD 5670 or Intel® HD Graphics 4000,Network:,Broadband Internet connection,Storage:,5 GB available space","Recommended:,OS:,Windows® 7 / Windows® 8 / Windows® 10 64-bit,Processor:,Intel® Core™ i5-3330, AMD™ FX-6300, or better,Memory:,6 GB RAM,Graphics:,NVIDIA® GeForce® GTX 750 Ti or AMD™ Radeon™ R7 260X or better,Network:,Broadband Internet connection,Storage:,5 GB available space",Free To Play,

A massive, open world full of wonder and peril awaits you! Dive Into a Vast Underwater World You have crash-landed on an alien ocean world, and the only way to go is down. Subnautica's oceans range from sun drenched shallow coral reefs to treacherous deep-sea trenches, lava fields, and bio-luminescent underwater rivers. Manage your oxygen supply as you explore kelp forests, plateaus, reefs, and winding cave systems. The water teems with life: Some of it helpful, much of it harmful. Scavenge, Craft, and Survive After crash landing in your Life Pod, the clock is ticking to find water, food, and to develop the equipment you need to explore. Collect resources from the ocean around you. Craft diving gear, lights, habitat modules, and submersibles. Venture deeper and further form to find rarer resources, allowing you to craft more advanced items. Construct Underwater Habitats Build bases on the sea floor. Choose layouts and components, and manage hull-integrity as depth and pressure increase. Use your base to store resources, park vehicles, and replenish oxygen supplies as you explore the vast ocean. Unravel the Mystery What happened to this planet? Signs abound that something is not right. What caused you to crash? What is infecting the sea life? Who built the mysterious structures scattered around the ocean? Can you find a way to make it off the planet alive? Disrupt the Food Chain The ocean teems with life: Use the ecosystem to help you. Lure and distract a threatening creature with a fresh fish, or simply swim as fast as you can to avoid gnashing jaws of roaming predators. Handle the Pressure Build a Pressure Re-Active Waterproof Nanosuit, or PRAWN Suit, and explore extreme depth and heat. Modify the suit with mining drills, torpedo launchers, propulsion cannons, grappling hooks and more. Fear the Night As the sun goes down, the predators come out. The ocean is unforgiving of those caught unprepared in the darkness. Areas that are safe to explore during the day become treacherous at night, but also reveal a beauty that those who hide from the darkness will never see. Dive Below the Ocean Floor Cave systems wind below the sea bed, from dark claustrophobic passages to caverns lit by bio-luminescent life and burning-hot lava flows. Explore the world below the ocean floor, but watch your oxygen levels, and take care to avoid the threats lurking in the darkness.

New Vegas. It’s the kind of town where you dig your own grave prior to being shot in the head and left for dead…and that’s before things really get ugly. It’s a town of dreamers and desperados being torn apart by warring factions vying for complete control of this desert oasis. It’s a place where the right kind of person with the right kind of weaponry can really make a name for themselves, and make more than an enemy or two along the way. As you battle your way across the heat-blasted Mojave Wasteland, the colossal Hoover Dam, and the neon drenched Vegas Strip, you’ll be introduced to a colorful cast of characters, power-hungry factions, special weapons, mutated creatures and much more. Choose sides in the upcoming war or declare “winner takes all” and crown yourself the King of New Vegas in this follow-up to the 2008 videogame of the year, Fallout 3. Enjoy your stay. Key Features  Feel the Heat in New Vegas! Not even nuclear fallout could slow the hustle of Sin City. Explore the vast expanses of the desert wastelands – from the small towns dotting the Mojave Wasteland to the bright lights of the New Vegas strip. See the Great Southwest as could only be imagined in Fallout.  Feuding Factions, Colorful Characters and a Host of Hostiles! A war is brewing between rival factions with consequences that will change the lives of all the inhabitants of New Vegas. The choices you make will bring you into contact with countless characters, creatures, allies, and foes, and determine the final explosive outcome of this epic power struggle.  New Systems! Enjoy new additions to Fallout: New Vegas such as a Companion Wheel that streamlines directing your companions, a Reputation System that tracks the consequences of your actions, and the aptly titled Hardcore Mode to separate the meek from the mighty. Special melee combat moves have been added to bring new meaning to the phrase “up close and personal”.  Use V.A.T.S. to pause time in combat, target specific enemy body parts and queue up attacks, or get right to the action using the finely-tuned real-time combat mechanics.  An Arsenal of Shiny New Guns! With double the amount of weapons found in Fallout 3, you’ll have more than enough new and exciting ways to deal with the threats of the wasteland and the locals. In addition, Vault-Tec engineers have devised a new weapons configuration system that lets you tinker with your toys and see the modifications you make in real time.  Let it Ride! In a huge, open world with unlimited options you can see the sights, choose sides, or go it alone.

Welcome Home! The time has come to stake your claim on the Red Planet and build the first functioning human colonies on Mars!  All you need are supplies, oxygen, decades of training, experience with sandstorms, and a can-do attitude to discover the purpose of those weird black cubes that appeared out of nowhere. With a bit of sprucing up, this place is going to be awesome!  Surviving Mars is a sci-fi city builder all about colonizing Mars and surviving the process. Choose a space agency for resources and financial support before determining a location for your colony. Build domes and infrastructure, research new possibilities and utilize drones to unlock more elaborate ways to shape and expand your settlement. Cultivate your own food, mine minerals or just relax by the bar after a hard day’s work. Most important of all, though, is keeping your colonists alive. Not an easy task on a strange new planet.  There will be challenges to overcome. Execute your strategy and improve your colony’s chances of survival while unlocking the mysteries of this alien world. Are you ready? Mars is waiting for you.  Main Features: Building on a planet not fit for human life challenges you to build a smart, functional colony. Bad planning isn’t about traffic jams, it’s about survival of your colonists. You really don’t want rolling blackouts in a city constructed in a place without oxygen.  Each colonist is a unique individual with problems and strengths that influence the needs and behavior of the other colonists. Things can get really interesting if your chief scientists develops alcoholism after one too many long nights in the lab.  Retro-futuristic super structures housing colonists, factories and commercial buildings with their own “neighborhood personality.” Create colonies that value science over everything else, while tired workers drink their pay away at a local bar, or attempt a utopia among the stars.  Inspired by the classic sci-fi of Asimov and Clarke, Surviving Mars holds many secrets. During each playthrough players may encounter one of Mars’ individually crafted mysteries. Uncovering these secrets might bring your colony great fortune, or terrible ruin. What is that sphere that manifested itself outside colony HUB B, and is it friendly?  Combine static and random research through experimentation, which allows for a different experience for each journey through the game. Attain new scientific breakthroughs by exploring the uncharted terrain of Mars's surface. A sleek, modern take on the bright futurism of the 1960s. A time of exploration and adventure. Craft your own fantastic buildings, parks or even a mystery to share through Surviving Mars’s extensive and convenient modding tools.

Supraland is a First-Person Metroidvania Puzzle game. The main sources of inspiration are Zelda, Metroid and Portal. Supraland assumes that you are intelligent and lets you play independently. The story is minimal, gives you an overarching goal to pursue, and then sets you free. Despite child friendly visuals, the game targets experienced players. Playtime: ~12-25h - Metroidvania - You explore a large interconnected world in which most ways are at first unpassable until you find new abilities to overcome those obstacles. A cornerstone of Supraland's design was to create abilities that are so versatile, they will keep on surprising you by how many different usages they have. If you combine your abilities, the possibilities become even bigger. - Exploration - Most of the game is about exploring the sandbox world to track down secrets. Often you will think you are about to get out of bounds and beat the level designer, but right there is a chest waiting for you with a very rewarding upgrade. Supraland respects your lifetime and doesn't bloat the playtime with unlimited no-brainer collectibles. - Puzzle Design - The deeper you get into the game the more you will be facing creative puzzles you've never seen anywhere before, encouraging you to stop and think about what abilities you have and how you can use them in yet another way. Puzzle types that I already knew from other games were immediately rejected in the design process. And it's important to me that once you understand the idea behind a puzzle, you can pretty much immediately solve it instead of having to go through a cumbersome, frustrating execution. - Fighting - The fighting mechanics are inspired by old-school, fast-paced shooter games like Unreal, Doom and Quake, encouraging high-speed strafing and jumping while throwing shot after shot at hordes of charging enemies without ever having to worry about weapons reloading. - Free Demo - In the demo you can play the first big section of the game and decide if it's for you.

The new CRIMENET network offers a huge range of dynamic contracts, and players are free to choose anything from small-time convenience store hits or kidnappings, to big league cyber-crime or emptying out major bank vaults for that epic PAYDAY. While in DC, why not participate in the local community, and run a few political errands? Up to four friends co-operate on the hits, and as the crew progresses the jobs become bigger, better and more rewarding. Along with earning more money and becoming a legendary criminal comes a new character customization and crafting system that lets crews build and customize their own guns and gear. Key Features Rob Banks, Get Paid – Players must choose their crew carefully, because when the job goes down they will need the right mix of skills on their side. CRIMENET – The dynamic contract database lets gamers pick and choose from available jobs by connecting with local contacts such as Vlad the Ukrainian, shady politician ""The Elephant"", and South American drug trafficker Hector, all with their own agenda and best interests in mind. PAYDAY Gun Play and Mechanics on a New Level – Firing weapons and zip tying civilians never felt so good. Dynamic Scenarios – No heist ever plays out the same way twice. Every single scenario has random geometry or even rare events. Choose Your Skills – As players progress they can invest in any of five special Skill Trees: Mastermind, Enforcer, Ghost, Technician and Fugitive. Each features a deep customization tree of associated skills and equipment to master, and they can be mixed and matched to create the ultimate heister. More Masks than Ever – PAYDAY 2 features a completely new mask system, giving players the ability to craft their own unique mask together with a pattern and a color combination, resulting in millions of different combinations. Weapons and Modifications – A brand new arsenal for the serious heister, covering everything from sniper and assault rifles to compact PDWs and SMGs. Once you've settled for a favorite, you can modify it with optics, suppressors, fore grips, reticles, barrels, frames, stocks and more, all of which will affect the performance of your weapon. There are also purely aesthetic enhancements - why not go for the drug lord look with polished walnut grips for your nine? Play It Your Way – Each job allows for multiple approaches, such as slow and stealthy ambushes, to running in guns blazing. Hit the target any way you want, and watch as the heist unfolds accordingly.

Each weapon comes with its own unique advantages and disadvantages, encouraging wildly different play styles. These include not only the way a weapon shoots but also the 'tells' the weapon leaves such as the smoke from the blunderbuss or the trail of fire behind the Hobby Horse. From traditional favourites such as Deathmatch to the completely unique Murder Mystery that challenges you to find and frag your specific target with a specific weapon. Play in teams or all against all. Challenge up to seven of your mates on the couch or online or a combination of both, the game is always split screen whether you are on or offline. When your friends aren't around, train your skills and learn the maps in the solo time trials or play against AI bots. In the spirit of the best arena shooters you’ll spend time traversing 11 maps via air vents and trampolines until you’ve acquired your target and fragged them accordingly. Each map is designed with colour-coded areas as well as plentiful landmarks such as statues, paintings and furniture that allow you to quickly locate other players without being able to actually see them. Inspired by games like Towerfall we've provided players with a highly granular level of customisation to play the game the way they want to. Choose which weapons you'll allow, how and when they can be swapped or reloaded, apply time limits, adjust the victory conditions, penalties and more.

Space Engineers features a realistic, volumetric-based physics engine: everything in the game can be assembled, disassembled, damaged and destroyed. The game can be played either in single or multiplayer modes. Volumetric objects are structures composed from block-like modules interlocked in a grid. Volumetric objects behave like real physical objects with mass, inertia and velocity. Individual modules have real volume and storage capacity. Space Engineers is inspired by reality and by how things work. Think about modern-day NASA technology extrapolated 60 years into the future. Space Engineers strives to follow the laws of physics and doesn't use technologies that wouldn't be feasible in the near future. Space Engineers concentrates on construction and exploration aspects, but can be played as a survival shooter as well. We expect players will avoid engaging in direct man-to-man combat and instead use their creativity and engineering skills to build war machines and fortifications to survive in space and on planets.

Enjoy a classic RPG experience inspired by games like Baldur's Gate, Fallout 1 and 2 and Arcanum. Explore and conquer the Stolen Lands and make them your kingdom! Based on our players' feedback and suggestions, this version of the game improves and builds upon the original. This edition includes: • numerous gameplay-enriching content additions and dozens of quality-of-life features • new abilities and ways to build your character, including a brand-new class • new items and weaponry • improved balance, especially in the beginning and last two chapters of the game • enhanced kingdom management system, both in terms of balance as well as usability and player comfort • increased variety of random encounters on the global map • thousands of fixes and improvements made since the game's initial release Explore the Stolen Lands, a region that has been contested territory for centuries: Hundreds of kingdoms have risen and fallen in these lands, and now it is time for you to make your mark—by building your own kingdom! To do so, you’ll need to survive the harsh wilderness and the threat of rival nations… as well as threats within your own court. Customize your character with a wide range of classes and powers including specialized archetypes, powerful arcane and divine spells, choosing from a multitude of class abilities, skills, and feats. Pathfinder allows players to create heroes (or villains) that fit both their individual gameplay styles and their personalities. Meet a diverse cast of companions and NPCs, including iconic characters from the Pathfinder setting itself. You’ll need to decide who to trust and who to watch carefully, as each companion has an agenda, alignment, and goals that may differ from yours. Your journey will become their journey, and you’ll help shape their lives both in the moment and well into the future. Conquer new regions as claim them as your own, carving your kingdom from the wilderness. While classic dungeon crawling and exploration lie at the heart of this adventure, diplomacy, politics, and kingdom development are also part of the challenge. Choose your allies well, and keep them close while exploring ancient tombs and ruins — and while dealing with politics in your own court.

And then you must carry out that strategy in the face of strange and terrible enemies. On board derelict spaceships you’ll plan your mission, taking note of the ship layout, what hazards and enemies you might encounter and what terminals and other ship systems you can use to your advantage..

React to what you find - will you detour to the generator to bring the power back online or will you fight your way into the security module to disable the ship’s defenses?

Use your hard won supplies to improvise tools and weapons, from the distracting robo-kitty to the horribly unstable clusterflak. Navigate your tiny escape pod through the vast nebula. Flee from void whales and pirates, and politely avoid the hungry hermits. All the while you must keep scavenging for the food, fuel, and other resources that keep you alive. Void Bastards features a 12-15 hour campaign that you can complete with an endless supply of prisoners, each with their own unique traits. When one dies, another steps forward to carry on the fight.

Avenge the death of your parents and help repel the invading forces! Story: Bohemia – located in the heart of Europe, the region is rich in culture, silver, and sprawling castles. The death of its beloved ruler, Emperor Charles IV, has plunged the kingdom into dark times: war, corruption, and discord are tearing this jewel of the Holy Roman Empire apart. One of Charles' sons, Wenceslas, has inherited the crown. Unlike his father, Wenceslas is a naive, self-indulgent, unambitious monarch. His half-brother and King of Hungary, Sigismund the Red Fox, senses weakness in Wenceslas. Feigning good will, Sigismund travels to Bohemia and kidnaps his half-brother. With no king on the throne, Sigismund is now free to plunder Bohemia and seize its riches. In the midst of this chaos, you're Henry, the son of a blacksmith. Your peaceful life is shattered when a mercenary raid, ordered by King Sigismund himself, burns your village to the ground. By bittersweet fortune, you are one of the few survivors of this massacre.

Play your way in a world where mysticism and industry collide. Will you choose to play as Empress Emily Kaldwin or the royal protector, Corvo Attano? Will you make your way through the game unseen, make full use of its brutal combat system, or use a blend of both? How will you combine your character's unique set of powers, weapons and gadgets to eliminate your enemies? The story responds to your choices, leading to intriguing outcomes, as you play through each of the game's hand-crafted missions. Story Dishonored 2 is set 15 years after the Lord Regent has been vanquished and the dreaded Rat Plague has passed into history. An otherworldly usurper has seized Empress Emily Kaldwin’s throne, leaving the fate of the Isles hanging in the balance. As Emily or Corvo, travel beyond the legendary streets of Dunwall to Karnaca, the once-dazzling coastal city that holds the keys to restoring Emily to power. Armed with the Mark of the Outsider and powerful new abilities, track down your enemies and take back what’s rightfully yours. Key Features The Assassins As fully voiced characters, Emily Kaldwin and Corvo Attano now bring their own perspectives and emotional responses to the world and story. Use each character’s set of powers, gadgets and uniquely-tuned weapons in creative ways as you explore the world – whether you fight your way through the city streets or sneak across the rooftops - and which enemies you decide to eliminate or spare. Supernatural Powers Advanced bonecharm crafting and all-new upgrade trees allow you to customize your powers in vastly different ways. Become a living shadow to silently stalk your targets, link enemies so they share a common fate, or mesmerize your foes and dominate their minds.

Imaginative World From the grimy, rat-infested streets of Dunwall to the lush, exotic coasts of a decaying Karnaca, immerse yourself in stylized locales created by Arkane’s premiere art and narrative teams. The world is a character in its own right, rich with story, architecture and eclectic characters. It is also punctuated by signature mission locations, such as the Dust District, ravaged by dust storms and warring factions, and a madman’s mansion made of shifting walls, deadly traps and clockwork soldiers.

Designed to support world-class art direction and take full advantage of the powerful hardware this generation has to offer, the Void Engine allows for significant advances to all game systems, including responsive stealth and combat Artificial Intelligence, lighting and graphical rendering, impressively dense urban environments, and story presentation.

As players explore an open-world environment in Ancient Greece, they interact with characters, infiltrate enemy bases and strongholds, and kill human enemies. Players use swords, spears, and bows to kill enemy soldiers and bandits in melee-style combat. Players also use stealth attacks (e.g., knife stabbing) to dispatch enemies discreetly. Large blood-splatter effects occur as enemies are killed. A handful of cutscenes depict more intense acts of violence and/or gore: characters stabbed through the head/neck with bladed weapons; young characters thrown off a cliff; a man mauled by a mob as his arm gets thrown into the air. Some environments depict severed limbs and dismembered corpses on the ground. The game contains instances of sexual material: characters kissing and caressing before the screen fades to black (sex is implied though never shown); dialogue referencing sex and prostitution (e.g., “Anything goes in this sex andron”; “That is love, this is commerce. What are you into?”); a character hearing sexual moaning sounds behind a door. The words “f**k” and “sh*t” are heard in the game.

Since, I have been waiting in anticipation for their next project. This time, they have created a fan fiction game based off the world-renowned ""Touhou Project."" From the background to the character's movements and various skills, one can feel the creator's passion for games and love of the Touhou project. While it is a 2D search game similar to Castlevania, the game can easily progress without the insistence of repeat elements or collecting items. This has resulted in a spectacular game born from the game production skills cultivated by Team Ladybug. And I personally want to highlight the beauty of the anime sprite.

Inspired by Dwarf Fortress, Firefly, and Dune. You begin with three survivors of a shipwreck on a distant world. Manage colonists' moods, needs, wounds, illnesses and addictions. Build in the forest, desert, jungle, tundra, and more. Watch colonists develop and break relationships with family members, lovers, and spouses. Replace wounded limbs and organs with prosthetics, bionics, or biological parts harvested from others. Fight pirates, tribes, mad animals, giant insects and ancient killing machines. Craft structures, weapons, and apparel from metal, wood, stone, cloth, and futuristic materials. Tame and train cute pets, productive farm animals, and deadly attack beasts. Trade with passing ships and caravans. Form caravans complete quests, trade, attack other factions, or migrate your whole colony. Dig through snow, weather storms, and fight fires. Capture refugees or prisoners and turn them to your side or sell them into slavery. Discover a new generated world each time you play. Explore hundreds of wild and interesting mods on the Steam Workshop. Learn to play easily with the help of an intelligent and unobtrusive AI tutor. RimWorld is a story generator. It’s designed to co-author tragic, twisted, and triumphant stories about imprisoned pirates, desperate colonists, starvation and survival. It works by controlling the “random” events that the world throws at you. Every thunderstorm, pirate raid, and traveling salesman is a card dealt into your story by the AI Storyteller . There are several storytellers to choose from. Randy Random does crazy stuff, Cassandra Classic goes for rising tension, and Phoebe Chillax likes to relax. Your colonists are not professional settlers – they’re crash-landed survivors from a passenger liner destroyed in orbit. You can end up with a nobleman, an accountant, and a housewife. You’ll acquire more colonists by capturing them in combat and turning them to your side, buying them from slave traders, or taking in refugees. So your colony will always be a motley crew. Each person’s background is tracked and affects how they play. A nobleman will be great at social skills (recruiting prisoners, negotiating trade prices), but refuse to do physical work. A farm oaf knows how to grow food by long experience, but cannot do research. A nerdy scientist is great at research, but cannot do social tasks at all. A genetically engineered assassin can do nothing but kill – but he does that very well. Colonists develop - and destroy - relationships. Each has an opinion of the others, which determines whether they'll become lovers, marry, cheat, or fight. Perhaps your two best colonists are happily married - until one of them falls for the dashing surgeon who saved her from a gunshot wound. The game generates a whole planet from pole to equator. You choose whether to land your crash pods in a cold northern tundra, a parched desert flat, a temperate forest, or a steaming equatorial jungle. Different areas have different animals, plants, diseases, temperatures, rainfall, mineral resources, and terrain. These challenges of surviving in a disease-infested, choking jungle are very different from those in a parched desert wasteland or a frozen tundra with a two-month growing season. Travel across the planet. You're not stuck in one place. You can form a caravan of people, animals, and prisoners. Rescue kidnapped former allies from pirate outposts, attend peace talks, trade with other factions, attack enemy colonies, and complete other quests. You can even pack up your entire colony and move to a new place. You can use rocket-powered transport pods to travel faster. You can tame and train animals. Lovable pets will cheer up sad colonists. Farm animals can be worked, milked, and sheared. Attack beasts can be released upon your enemies. There are many animals - cats, labrador retrievers, grizzly bears, camels, cougars, chinchillas, chickens, and exotic alien-like lifeforms. People in RimWorld constantly observe their situation and surroundings in order to decide how to feel at any given moment. They respond to hunger and fatigue, witnessing death, disrespectfully unburied corpses, being wounded, being left in darkness, getting packed into cramped environments, sleeping outside or in the same room as others, and many other situations. If they're too stressed, they might lash out or break down. Wounds, infections, prosthetics, and chronic conditions are tracked on each body part and affect characters' capacities. Eye injuries make it hard to shoot or do surgery. Wounded legs slow people down. Hands, brain, mouth, heart, liver, kidneys, stomach, feet, fingers, toes, and more can all be wounded, diseased, or missing, and all have logical in-game effects. And other species have their own body layouts - take off a deer's leg, and it can still hobble on the other three. Take off a rhino's horn, and it's much less dangerous. You can repair body parts with prosthetics ranging from primitive to transcendent. A peg leg will get Joe Colonist walking after an unfortunate incident with a rhinoceros, but he'll still be quite slow. Buy an expensive bionic leg from a trader the next year, and Joe becomes a superhuman runner. You can even extract, sell, buy, and transplant internal organs. And there's much more than that!

Use your cunning and resources to kill or tame & breed the leviathan dinosaurs and other primeval creatures roaming the land, and team up with or prey on hundreds of other players to survive, dominate... and escape! Dinosaurs, Creatures, & Breeding! -- over 100+ creatures can be tamed using a challenging capture-&-affinity process, involving weakening a feral creature to knock it unconscious, and then nursing it back to health with appropriate food. Once tamed, you can issue commands to your tames, which it may follow depending on how well you’ve tamed and trained it. Tames, which can continue to level-up and consume food, can also carry Inventory and Equipment such as Armor, carry prey back to your settlement depending on their strength, and larger tames can be ridden and directly controlled! Fly a Pterodactyl over the snow-capped mountains, lift allies over enemy walls, race through the jungle with a pack of Raptors, tromp through an enemy base along a gigantic brontosaurus, or chase down prey on the back of a raging T-Rex! Take part in a dynamic ecosystem life-cycle with its own predator & prey hierarchies, where you are just one creature among many species struggling for dominance and survival. Tames can also be mated with the opposite gender, to selectively breed successive generations using a trait system based on recombinant genetic inheritance. This process includes both egg-based incubation and mammalian gestation lifecycles! Or put more simply, raise babies! You must eat and drink to survive, with different kinds of plants & meat having different nutritional properties, including human meat. Ensuring a supply of fresh water to your home and inventory is a pressing concern. All physical actions come at a cost of food and water, long-distance travel is fraught with subsistence peril! Inventory weight makes you move slower, and the day/night cycle along with randomized weather patterns add another layer of challenge by altering the temperature of the environment, causing you to hunger or thirst more quickly. Build a fire or shelter, and craft a large variety of customizable clothing & armors, to help protect yourself against locational damage & extreme temperatures using the dynamic indoor/outdoor insulation calculation system! By chopping down forests full of trees and mining metal and other precious resources, you can craft the parts to build massive multi-leveled structures composed of complex snap-linked parts, including ramps, beams, pillars, windows, doors, gates, remote gates, trapdoors, water pipes, faucets, generators, wires and all manner of electrical devices, and ladders among many other types. Structures have a load system to fall apart if enough support has been destroyed, so reinforcing your buildings is important. All structures and items can be painted to customize the look of your home, as well as placing dynamically per-pixel paintable signs, textual billboards, and other decorative objects. Shelter reduces the extremes of weather and provides security for yourself and your stash! Weapons, clothing & armor gear can also be painted to express your own visual style. Pick seeds from the wild vegetation around you, plant them in plots that you lay down, water them and nurture them with fertilizer (everything poops after consuming calories, which can then be composted, and some fertilizer is better than others). Tend to your crops and they will grow to produce delicious and rare fruits, which can also be used to cook a plethora of logical recipes and make useful tonics! Explore to find the rarest of plant seeds that have the most powerful properties! Vegetarians & vegans can flourish, and it will be possible to master and conquer the ARK in a non-violent manner! By bringing sufficient rare sacrificial items to special Summon locations, you can capture the attention of the one of the ARK’s god-like mythical creatures, who will arrive for battle. These gargantuan monstrosities provide an end-game goal for the most experienced groups of players and their armies of tames, and will yield extremely valuable progression items if they are defeated. Create a Tribe and add your friends to it, and all your tames can be commanded by and allied to anyone in your Tribe. Your Tribe will also be able to respawn at any of your home spawn points. Promote members to Tribe Admins to reduce the burden of management. Distribute key items and pass-codes to provide access your shared village! All items are crafted from Blueprints that have variable statistics and qualities, and require corresponding resources. More remote and harsh locales across the ARK tend to have better resources, including the tallest mountains, darkest caves, and depths of the ocean! Level-Up your player character by gaining experience through performance actions, Level-Up your tames, and learn new ""Engrams"" to be able to craft Items from memory without the use of blueprints, even if you die! Customize the underlying physical look of your character with hair, eye, and skin tones, along with an array of body proportion modifiers. As you explore the vast ARK, you'll find clues left by other Survivors who have made the ARK their home in ages past, in the form of collectible detailed 3D ""Explorer Notes"". By uncovering all of these, you can begin to piece together the true nature of the ARK, and discover its purpose! Everything you craft has durability and will wear-out from extended use if not repaired, and when you leave the game, your character remains sleeping in the persistent world. Your inventory physically exists in boxes or on your character in the world. Everything can be looted & stolen, so to achieve security you must build-up, team-up, or have tames to guard your stash. Death is permanent, and you can even knock out, capture, and force-feed other players to use them for your own purposes, such as extracting their blood to for transfusions, harvesting their fecal matter to use as fertilizer, or using them as food for your carnivorous tames! The mysterious ARK is a formidable and imposing environment, composed of many natural and unnatural structures, above-ground, below-ground, and underwater. By fully exploring its secrets, you’ll find the most exotic procedurally randomized creatures and rare blueprints. Also to be found are Explorer Notes that are dynamically updated into the game, written by previous human denizens of the ARK from across the millennia, creatively detailing the creatures and backstory of the ARK and its creatures. Fully develop your in-game ARK-map through exploration, write custom points of interest onto it, and craft a Compass or GPS coordinates to aid exploring with other players, whom you can communicate with via proximity text & voice chat, or long-distance radio. Construct & draw in-game signs for other players to help them or lead them astray...  And yet.. how do you ultimately challenge the Creators and Conquer the ARK? A definitive end-game is planned. On the 100+ player servers, your character, everything you built, and your tames, stay in-game even when you leave. You can even physically travel your character and items between the network of ARK's by accessing the Obelisks and uploading (or downloading) your data from the Steam Economy! A galaxy of ARKs, each slightly different than the previous, to leave your mark on and conquer, one at a time -- special official ARKs will be unveiled on the World-map for limited times in singular themed events with corresponding limited-run items! Furthermore, you can now design or randomize your own unique 'Procedurally Generated ARKs', for infinite replayability and endless surprises. You can play single-player local games, and bring your character and items between unofficial player-hosted servers, back and forth from singleplayer to multiplayer.

Banish these creatures from our world, and you will be paid generously—and given the chance to buy more gruesome and powerful weapons. Fail, and death will strip you of both character and gear. Your experience, however, remains in your pool of hunters—called your Bloodline—always. HIGH RISK, HIGH REWARD, HIGH TENSION Hunt’s competitive, match-based gameplay mixes PvP and PvE elements to create a uniquely tense experience where your life, your character, and your gear are always on the line. At the beginning of each Bounty Hunt match, depending on whether you have chosen team play or solo play, up to five teams of two or ten solo players set out to track their monstrous targets. Once they’ve found and defeated one of these they will receive a bounty—and instantly become a target for every other Hunter left on the map. If you don’t watch your back, you’ll find a knife in it, and your last memory will be of someone else walking away with your prize. The higher the risk, the higher the reward–but a single mistake could cost you everything. Hunt's Quick Play game mode offers a shorter match, during which up to ten individual players race to scavenge gear and find and close four rifts as they compete for a diminishing pool of bounty. First Hunter to the final rift absorbs its energy, but must survive the final count down to complete the mission—while the other Hunters attempt to take them out and take the prize for themselves. When the timer runs out the winner keeps their Hunter, while the rest perish. PROGRESSION Even in death, you will be able to progress among the ranks of Hunters via your Bloodline. Though one character may die, their experience will be transferred to your Bloodline, where it can be applied your other Hunters. If you make it off of the map alive, you will be able to use the money and experience you earn to kit out new Hunters and prepare for the next match. If you die, you lose everything but your experience. DARK SIGHT Dark Sight allows Hunters to see into the veil between worlds, making that which cannot be seen by mortal eyes visible to those who have been initiated. Use Dark Sight when you are tracking monsters, and a ghostly light will guide you toward your next target. Dark Sight also marks players carrying a bounty, making them more vulnerable to ambush while trying to escape."," Mature Content Description  The developers describe the content like this:  This Game may contain content not appropriate for all ages, or may not be appropriate for viewing at work: Frequent Violence or Gore, General Mature Content  ","Minimum:,Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system,OS:,Windows 7 64bit,Processor:,Intel i5-4590 @ 3.3GHz (4th Generation) or AMD Ryzen 3 1200,Memory:,8 GB RAM,Graphics:,NVIDIA GeForce GTX 660 TI or AMD Radeon R7 370,DirectX:,Version 11,Network:,Broadband Internet connection,Storage:,20 GB available space,Sound Card:,DirectX compatible audio card,Additional Notes:,Best experienced with headphones","Recommended:,Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system,OS:,Windows 10 64 bit,Processor:,Intel i5-6600 @ 3.3Ghz (6th Generation) or AMD Ryzen 5 1400,Memory:,12 GB RAM,Graphics:,NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970 4 GB or AMD Radeon R9 390X,DirectX:,Version 11,Network:,Broadband Internet connection,Storage:,20 GB available space,Sound Card:,DirectX compatible audio card,Additional Notes:,Best experienced with headphones",$29.99,$23.99

Setting Once every decade, elder dragons trek across the sea to travel to the land known as the New World in a migration referred to as the Elder Crossing. To get to the bottom of this mysterious phenomenon, the Guild has formed the Research Commission, dispatching them in large fleets to the New World. As the Commission sends its Fifth Fleet in pursuit of the colossal elder dragon, Zorah Magdaros, one hunter is about to embark on a journey grander than anything they could have ever imagined.

Many hunters acquire proficiency in multiple types, while others prefer to attain mastery of one. Scoutflies Monster tracks, such as footprints and gashes, dot each locale. Your Scoutflies will remember the scent of a monster and guide you to other nearby tracks. And as you gather more tracks, the Scoutflies will give you even more information. Slinger The Slinger is an indispensable tool for a hunter, allowing you to arm yourself with stones and nuts that can be gathered from each locale.

Simple to use, they can be selected and activated just like any other item you take out on a hunt. Palicoes Palicoes are hunters' reliable comrades out in the field, specialized in a variety of offensive, defensive, and restorative support abilities.

Explore Earth and our neighboring worlds in the Solar System, orbit a black hole in a galaxy billions of light-years away, or visit anything in between seamlessly, with no transitions. All of time and space are yours to explore – cruise between the stars at a million times the speed of light, and accelerate time to watch the orbital motions of a thousand worlds play out before your eyes. Every planet you encounter in your journey will feature procedural 3D terrain with detailed textures. Everything you see in the sky – stars and galaxies, planets and moons, asteroids and comets, black holes and neutron stars, star clusters and nebulae – are yours to explore at the press of a button. Spacecraft with Newtonian physics and pilot-assist autopilot features (in early development but fully usable) are yours to fly anywhere in the universe in the Flight Simulator mode. SpaceEngine is also very friendly for creators of mods and add-ons – create your own planets, star systems, even galaxies, import your own spacecraft models, create custom GUI skins, and more, all easily sharable with others. With SpaceEngine, the possibilities are limitless. SpaceEngine Planetarium capabilities: Astronomy All types of celestial objects are represented: galaxies, nebulae, stars and star clusters, planets and moons, comets and asteroids. Known celestial objects are represented using data from catalogs: galaxies (NGC/IC), stars (HIPPARCOS), star clusters, nebulae, and planets (Solar System and known extrasolar planets). Regions of space not yet cataloged feature procedurally generated objects: galaxies, stars, star clusters, nebulae, and planetary systems. Controls You are free to move around the universe – travel seamlessly between any object and any distance, from surface to orbit to interstellar and intergalactic space. Moving through space is as easy as ""click and go"", as well as game-style free flight using the WASD keys or a gamepad. Also, time travel is possible: you can accelerate, decelerate, or reverse the flow of time, and jump to a specified date. Detailed interactive tutorials will familiarize you with the controls. Graphics Volumetric 3D models of galaxies and nebulae with interstellar dust clouds, and 3D landscapes on planets and stars. For many Solar System bodies, actual data from space probes is used, with huge, high-resolution texture packs available as free DLC. For unmapped and procedural planets, the surface is generated procedurally using your computer's GPU. Other features include realistic atmospheric scattering, eclipse shadows, animated auroras and comet tails, and physically-based light warping near black holes and neutron stars, with animated accretion disks and jets. Physics Realistic and physically-based generation of procedural objects (galaxies, star systems, planets) and their physical properties (mass, radius, temperature, atmospheric parameters, etc). The orbital motion of planets, moons, and stars in multiple-star systems are accurately calculated and displayed. Realistic space ship design concepts and physics: orbital motion, atmospheric flight model, and Alcubierre warp drive physics. Virtual reality SpaceEngine supports HTC Vive, Oculus Rift (via native library), and Windows Mixed Reality (via Steam VR). Support of VR controllers is partial: you can select objects with one controller and move around with the other one. Please note that VR support is still a work in progress, and new users should become familiar with the program in 2D before trying to use VR. Sound Original background music tracks made by many authors, with context-sensitive playback. Sound effects for planetary environments and space ships are in development. Tools Built-in tutorials will help you start using the Planetarium. Search for celestial objects by name and search for the nearest star systems. Browse the cosmos using a scalable Universe map and planetary system chart. Saving, exporting, and importing of locations is supported, which can easily be shared between users. The program keeps an automatic journal of objects you have recently visited. Learn every detail about the objects you find using the built-in “Wiki” info system, with additional hand-written descriptions of many known objects. Display the orbital paths of celestial objects, labels and markers, constellations, and other informational tools. Multi-language support Currently SpaceEngine is available in English, German, French, Italian, Spanish, Dutch, Finnish, Swedish, Croatian, Czech, Polish, Russian, and Catalan languages. Many new localizations are under development. Only localizations which are 100% complete are displayed on the Steam store page, but you can enable others in-game. Modding SpaceEngine supports creating and importing user add-ons: catalogs, models and textures for deep space objects, planets, and space ships. Spacecraft models, representing both real and fictional designs – including from popular sci-fi franchises – are commonly imported and shared by the community, both here on Steam and on the official SpaceEngine forum.

Dead by Daylight is a multiplayer (4vs1) horror game where one player takes on the role of the savage Killer, and the other four players play as Survivors, trying to escape the Killer and avoid being caught, tortured and killed.  Survivors play in third-person and have the advantage of better situational awareness. The Killer plays in first-person and is more focused on their prey.  The Survivors' goal in each encounter is to escape the Killing Ground without getting caught by the Killer - something that sounds easier than it is, especially when the environment changes every time you play. More information about the game is available at http://www.deadbydaylight.com Key Features • Survive Together… Or Not - Survivors can either cooperate with the others or be selfish. Your chance of survival will vary depending on whether you work together as a team or if you go at it alone. Will you be able to outwit the Killer and escape their Killing Ground? • Where Am I? - Each level is procedurally generated, so you’ll never know what to expect. Random spawn points mean you will never feel safe as the world and its danger change every time you play. • A Feast for Killers - Dead by Daylight draws from all corners of the horror world. As a Killer you can play as anything from a powerful Slasher to terrifying paranormal entities. Familiarize yourself with your Killing Grounds and master each Killer’s unique power to be able to hunt, catch and sacrifice your victims. • Deeper and Deeper - Each Killer and Survivor has their own deep progression system and plenty of unlockables that can be customized to fit your own personal strategy. Experience, skills and understanding of the environment are key to being able to hunt or outwit the Killer. • Real People, Real Fear - The procedural levels and real human reactions to pure horror makes each game session an unexpected scenario. You will never be able to tell how it’s going to turn out. Ambience, music, and chilling environments combine into a terrifying experience. With enough time, you might even discover what’s hiding in the fog.

Become Ruler of the World by establishing and leading a civilization from the Stone Age to the Information Age. Wage war, conduct diplomacy, advance your culture, and go head-to-head with history’s greatest leaders as you attempt to build the greatest civilization the world has ever known. Civilization VI offers new ways to engage with your world: cities now physically expand across the map, active research in technology and culture unlocks new potential, and competing leaders will pursue their own agendas based on their historical traits as you race for one of five ways to achieve victory in the game. EXPANSIVE EMPIRES: See the marvels of your empire spread across the map like never before. Each city spans multiple tiles so you can custom build your cities to take full advantage of the local terrain. ACTIVE RESEARCH: Unlock boosts that speed your civilization’s progress through history. To advance more quickly, use your units to actively explore, develop your environment, and discover new cultures. DYNAMIC DIPLOMACY: Interactions with other civilizations change over the course of the game, from primitive first interactions where conflict is a fact of life, to late game alliances and negotiations. COMBINED ARMS: Expanding on the “one unit per tile” design, support units can now be embedded with other units, like anti-tank support with infantry, or a warrior with settlers. Similar units can also be combined to form powerful “Corps” units. ENHANCED MULTIPLAYER: In addition to traditional multiplayer modes, cooperate and compete with your friends in a wide variety of situations all designed to be easily completed in a single session. A CIV FOR ALL PLAYERS:  Civilization VI provides veteran players new ways to build and tune their civilization for the greatest chance of success.

DESTROY THEIRS.  Total War: WARHAMMER II is a strategy game of titanic proportions. Choose from four unique, varied factions and wage war your way – mounting a campaign of conquest to save or destroy a vast and vivid fantasy world.  This is a game of two halves – one a turn-based open-world campaign, and the other intense, tactical real-time battles across the fantastical landscapes of the New World. Play how you choose – delve into a deep engrossing campaign, experience unlimited replayability and challenge the world in multiplayer with a custom army of your favourite units. Total War: WARHAMMER II offers hundreds of hours of gameplay and no two games are the same. World-Spanning Conquest Engage in statecraft, diplomacy, exploration and build your empire, turn by turn. Capture, build and manage teeming settlements and recruit vast armies. Level up Legendary Lords and Heroes and arm them with mythical weapons and armour. Negotiate alliances or declare Total War to subjugate any that stand between you and your goal. Epic Real-Time Battles Command thousands-strong legions of soldiers in intense tactical battles. Send forth ferocious, twisted monsters, fire-breathing dragons and harness powerful magic. Utilise military strategies, lay ambushes, or use brute force to turn the tide of combat and lead your forces to victory. The second in a trilogy and sequel to the award-winning Total War: WARHAMMER, Total War: WARHAMMER II brings players a breath-taking new narrative campaign, set across the vast continents of Lustria, Ulthuan, Naggaroth and the Southlands. The Great Vortex Campaign builds pace to culminate in a definitive and climactic endgame, an experience unlike any other Total War title to date. Playing as one of 8 Legendary Lords across 4 iconic races from the world of Warhammer Fantasy Battles, players must succeed in performing a series of powerful arcane rituals in order to stabilise or disrupt The Great Vortex, while foiling the progress of the other races. Each Legendary Lord has a unique geographical starting position, and each race offers a distinctive new playstyle with unique campaign mechanics, narrative, methods of war, armies, monsters, Lores of Magic, legendary characters, and staggering new battlefield army abilities. Shortly after launch, owners of both the original game and Total War™ WARHAMMER II will gain access to the colossal third campaign. Exploring a single open-world epic map covering the Old World and the New World, players may embark on monumental campaigns as any owned Race from both titles. Conquer the world, together Each of the Races in Total War™ WARHAMMER II will be playable in single and multiplayer campaign, plus custom and multiplayer battles. As the two Legendary Lords for each race all have their own unique campaign start positions, you’ll be able to play a 2-player co-op campaign as the same race. If you own both parts 1 and 2, you’ll be able to play in multiplayer as any of the races you own. The World of Total War: WARHAMMER II Millennia ago, besieged by a Chaos invasion, a conclave of High Elf mages forged a vast, arcane vortex. Its purpose was to draw the Winds of Magic from the world as a sinkhole drains an ocean, and blast the Daemonic hordes back to the Realm of Chaos. Now the Great Vortex falters, and the world again stands at the brink of ruin. Powerful forces move to heal the maelstrom and avert catastrophe. Yet others seek to harness its terrible energies for their own bitter purpose. The race is on, and the very fate of the world will lie in the hands of the victor. Prince Tyrion, Defender of Ulthuan, guides the High Elves in their desperate efforts to stabilise the vortex as it roils above their home continent. Atop his palanquin-throne, the Slann Mage-Priest Mazdamundi directs his Lizardmen war-hosts as they surge northward from Lustria. He, too, is intent on preventing cataclysm, though the methods of The Old Ones must prevail. The Witch King Malekith and his sadistic Dark Elf hordes spew forth from Naggaroth and their labyrinthine Black Arks. He tastes great weakness in the vortex – and great opportunity in its demise. Meanwhile the Skaven, led by Queek Headtaker, stir in their foetid subterranean tunnels. There they multiply unchecked and look hungrily towards the surface, their motives obscured. The time for revelation is nigh… Four races, four outcomes, a single goal: control of the Great Vortex, for good or ill.

Traverse a fantastical open world: explore forgotten ruins, caves and shipwrecks, trade with merchants and dwarven smiths in cities, and hunt across the open plains, mountains and seas. Deal with treasonous generals, devious witches and corrupt royalty to provide dark and dangerous services. Make choices that go beyond good & evil, and face their far-reaching consequences. CHASE DOWN THE CHILD OF PROPHECY Take on the most important contract to track down the child of prophecy, a key to save or destroy this world. In times of war, chase down the child of prophecy, a living weapon foretold by ancient elven legends. Struggle against ferocious rulers, spirits of the wilds and even a threat from beyond the veil – all hell-bent on controlling this world. Define your destiny in a world that may not be worth saving. FULLY REALIZED NEXT GENERATION Built exclusively for next generation hardware, the REDengine 3 renders the world of The Witcher visually nuanced and organic, a real true to life fantasy. Dynamic weather systems and day/night cycles affect how the citizens of the towns and the monsters of the wilds behave.

Fly your pod up to any spaceship in the galaxy and dock with its airlock to sneak inside. From there, you've got to sneak up on the crew, outshoot them in slowmo gunfights, or outthink them with clever gadgets. Take missions to steal loot, assassinate VIPs, or rescue friends. Take your time! Get out of impossible situations by pausing at any time and taking as long as you need to figure out a clever plan. You have a wide range of gadgets with clever uses, and you can switch, aim and fire them with no time pressure at all, letting you pull off ridiculously cool tricks without needing twitch skills. Liberate the galaxy! All your missions get you closer to liberating new space stations from the empires that control them, and this unlocks new gadgets to buy in your shops, and special challenge characters to play. Lots more features! I'm not making GIFs for all these! I'm not made of GIFs! I'm not some kind of GIF-golem! Emergent gameplay! Use gadgets like teleporters, stealth shields and subverters to invent your own solutions to tricky situations. Galactic zoom! Zoom smoothly from a view of the whole galaxy down to your character sneaking up on guards inside the spaceship you're boarding. Choose your difficulty! You choose each mission, ranging from trivially easy to nightmarishly hard. There's also a practice mode where you can try items and tactics with no consequences and instant-restart. Randomly generated missions! Each one picks a random combination of guard kit, ship layout, and complications like space battles. Each life is a new character! Choose between randomly generated characters with different starting kit, and when you die, play as someone new in the same galaxy. Personal missions! Every character has one grand heist to work towards: rescue their brother, steal their gun back, get revenge on their partner's killer. Modular destruction! Blow up any part of a ship with breach grenades or fuel barrels. Rip a ship in half. Get sucked into space by the vacuum. Rescue your friends' characters! If someone on your friends list gets their character captured, and they aren't able to rescue them, maybe you can! You'll sometimes get a character whose personal goal is to rescue a friend's character. If you manage it, you unlock your friend's character to play as! They don't get it back. They had their chance. It's yours now. Find your friends' items! When you retire an accomplished character, you can choose one item to pass on. You get to name it, and both your Steam friends and your own future characters have a chance to find these as loot. Equally, you'll come across items your friends have named. What Heat Signature is not: We don't want you to buy Heat Signature if it's not for you. We'd always rather have a happy non-customer than an unhappy customer. So here's what it isn't: - It's not story-driven: there's a backstory to this place and a few conversations with characters, but there's not a story that develops as you play. It's much more about the stories you generate by playing, about how you got out of impossible situation X or pulled off crazy stunt Y. There aren't other careers: You can't mine asteroids. You can't build ships. You can't recruit a crew. You're an infiltrator, you break into spaceships for a living, it's all about that. There are no planets: The whole game takes place in this nebula full of space stations. You can dock at any friendly station and board any hostile ship, but it's not a space exploration game. It's not multiplayer: The friends features mentioned above are fun but they're just sharing content, it's not multiplayer at all and you're never in the same world together. There are cool games about all those things. This is a cool game about something else!",,,,$14.99,$22.47

If you are bored of waiting for fish to take and falling asleep in front of the computer, this means that you have played a bad game! In the Ultimate Fishing Simulator, this will never happen. Select the appropriate equipment and bait, cast your line and wait for a bite. Success is guaranteed. In addition to traditional fishing techniques, in Ultimate Fishing Simulator you’ll also find a winter map where you will be able to go ice fishing! Buy an auger at the store, find a suitable location and drill an air hole. But not too small, so that you can remove the fish. There are two modes of difficulties in the Ultimate Fishing Simulator, thanks to which there is something for everyone. Normal Mode allows you to enjoy the game in all its glory. In normal mode, all the features in the game are included. Realistic Mode requires more patience and efficiency from the player. Fish will be biting less and will fight longer. Some of the game features in this mode are disabled, such as the underwater camera. Every fisherman likes to admire his trophies. Some release their fish, other stuff and hang them on their walls. In Ultimate Fishing Simulator you can exactly do the same! Decide what you want to do with the fish you catch. Sell? Release? Stuff? The choice is yours. If the maps available in the game bore you, you can create your own. Be creative and build your own dream fishery that you can share other players thanks to the built-in level editor. Enjoy fishing with your friends on your favorite, family fishery. What more could you ask for?

We connect with friends. We buy the latest gadgets and gear. We find out what’s happening in the world. But with that same simple swipe, we cast an increasingly expansive shadow. With each connection, we leave a digital trail that tracks our every move and milestone, our every like and dislike. And it’s not just people. Today, all major cities are networked. Urban infrastructures are monitored and controlled by complex operating systems. In Watch_Dogs, this system is called the Central Operating System (CTOS) – and it controls almost every piece of the city’s technology and holds key information on all of the city’s residents. You play as Aiden Pearce, a brilliant hacker and former thug, whose criminal past led to a violent family tragedy.  Now on the hunt for those who hurt your family, you'll be able to monitor and hack all who surround you by manipulating everything connected to the city’s network. Access omnipresent security cameras, download personal information to locate a target, control traffic lights and public transportation to stop the enemy…and more. Use the city of Chicago as your ultimate weapon and exact your own style of revenge. KEY FEATURES HACK THE CITY Watch_Dogs takes place in a fully simulated living city where, using your smartphone, you have real-time control over the city’s infrastructure.  Trap your enemy in a 30-car pileup by manipulating the traffic lights. Stop a train, and then board it to evade the authorities. Narrowly escape capture by quickly raising a drawbridge. Anything connected to the city’s CTOS can become your weapon. STREET JUSTICE Living in inner city Chicago where violence is best answered by violence, you have the skills to take the fight to the streets. Take down enemies by delivering devastating blows with your baton, or experience a shoot-out like never before with a physics simulation that rivals anything in the shooter category. Use a combination of shooting and hacking to gain advantage in any given situation.  The streets are designed for you to create your own plan of attack. Overall, you will have access to more than 30 traditional weapons. HIGH OCTANE DRIVING Ubisoft Montreal has partnered with studios such as Ubisoft Reflections, the acclaimed studio behind the award-winning Driver series to bring you a game bursting with horsepower. Get behind the wheel of more than 65 vehicles, each with state of the art physics and handling, and explore the massive city while completing missions.  EVERYTHING IS UNDER CONTROL  Disrupt, the all-new game engine dedicated to Watch_Dogs, uses advanced processing and graphics to deliver a stunning visual and an incredibly realistic experience. Disrupt gives you the power to affect the story, the city and the life of the population with your choices creating a ripple effect throughout the city.

Most of the population remains unaware of their abuses of power, but to the most enigmatic order of the beloved Septian Church, the Gralsritter, snuffing out these would-be villains and claiming artifacts in their name is as everyday as professing one’s faith in the Goddess.  On the eve of another successfully completed mission, high-ranking member Father Kevin Graham is immediately assigned to retrieve one more artifact that rests beneath Grancel Cathedral. What’s more, even though this is a task he could easily complete on his own, he must reluctantly do so in partnership with his newest recruit, rookie Gralsritter and childhood friend Sister Ries Argent.  Thus begins the start of a routine mission that becomes anything but, delving into a new and mysterious realm that follows an unnaturally strict set of rules: Phantasma. Therein, the history of the Septian Church and the pasts of the many familiar faces who took up arms for the sake of Liberl’s future will be laid bare…and some may have been better off staying forever sealed behind closed doors.

Maybe you prefer the challenge of sailing across the Southern Oceans enduring the fiercest storms they have to offer? Or you just wish to learn to sail but have no access to a boat to do so? With Sailaway you can do all of these things. Sailaway - The Sailing Simulator brings all the world's oceans to the comfort of your PC or Mac for you to experience the ultimate in online virtual sailing! In Sailaway, the oceans of the planet have been recreated with unparalleled accuracy; making a trip across the Pacific take months, just as it would on a real boat. With a persistent online world, adjust your settings and your boat will continue to sail even if you aren’t online.  Receive updates via email as your boat continues its progress, but don't forget to check in often – with real-time weather data pulled from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) conditions can change in just a few hours. Sailaway gives players the most realistic digital sailing experience to date with in-depth simulations of weather, wind and currents while your boat and it’s sail are modelled to give even the most experienced sailor a work-out. The early difficulty modes will let you sail away while you learn the game and then it truly comes alive when the virtual help is removed and it’s you against the forces of nature. If you’re going to beat your friends then you’ll need to plot your course and constantly monitor your sail’s shape, use any slight advantage to help you arrive first! Sailaway includes a variety of lovingly created boats for you to sail the world in, these can all be customised in hundreds of combinations using the provided options or by uploading your own textures for that extra something special! With Steam Workshop integration you can then share these designs with other sailors to enjoy. 38′ Cruiser A 38' cruiser with good performance. With all the trim lines a sailor would desire. Mini-Transat A tiny boat for experienced sailors. It sails like a dinghy and is very fast on a reach. With all the sails and trim lines you'll need. Caribbean Rose The beautiful lines and craftsmanship of antique boats are reflected in the Caribbean Rose. Easy to sail, with a long keel. Cruising Catamaran The ideal boat for exploring the Pacific Islands. Easy to sail, little heel and solid as a rock. 50' Performance Cruiser A very fast boat, that could almost pass for a racer. For experienced sailors who know how to push a boat to the limit. Nordic Folkboat A small, but fierce boat with lots of character. Ideal for learning how to sail, because it only has a mainsheet and a rudder to control. 32' Offshore Racer Foiling monohull for club races. It’s fast, challenging and exciting. The foils increase stability and reduce drift. The ocean can sometimes feel like a lonely place which is why Sailaway includes plenty of ways to enjoy activities with friends and strangers alike. Real-time global, local and group chat will allow you to communicate freely with other sailors to organise your own voyages or even to just pass on sailing tips! Invite others to your boat to help tackle the voyage ahead or if you fancy some friendly competition you can invite them along with their boat to sail alongside each other, we make it easy to share the sailing experience with others. If competitive racing is more your thing then we also have you covered, Sailaway lets you take part in races across the globe! Record your finish times in our online leaderboards and challenge one another for the top spot. Maybe you have the creativity to design your own races? Sailaway allows all its sailors to create races for others to compete in via its Player Created Races feature. Sailaway has been designed to accurately simulate the wonders of sailing as realistically as possible, which means all the little details count! Real Sail Trim Every control you would expect to find on a real sailboat is here to use in Sailaway, you will be using sheets and trim lines to optimize the shape of your sails and gain every second you can on your journey or race. Real Weather The clouds, wind, fog, rain and snow are all simulated according to the real weather as provided by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). This means you can use actual weather predictions from your favorite weather service to plan your journey. Real Waves Sailaway simulates the waves accurately, taking the history of wind direction and wind speed into account, as well as current, water depth and nearby islands or shallow areas. The North Sea has different waves than the Atlantic Ocean or South Pacific and each present their own set of challenges. Real Water The colour of the water you sail upon is affected by a great many things, from the blue of pure water to the brownish colour of muddy rivers. Sailaway adjusts water colour by depth and other influences before it renders a single drop of water to make it as realistic as possible. Real Sky Our ancestors navigated by the stars which is why we made sure the positions of the sun, moon, planets and stars are all correct. There is even a handy feature that highlights the constellations but just like in the real world if the sky happens to be cloudy there will be nothing to see but darkness. Real Maps To aid navigation there is an interactive map that can zoom from world scale to small coves, displaying deep and shallow areas, rocks, buoys, lights and everything you need for a safe journey.",,,,$39.99,$23.99

The follow-up game to the award-winning Source mod, Insurgency is highly competitive and unforgivingly lethal, striking a balance between one-life gameplay and prolonged action. Features Over 40 weapons with numerous attachments, no crosshair, and a focus on realistic weapon behavior including a free-aim system and intense suppression effects. 16 maps playable in day and night versions on various multiplayer and cooperative modes, ranging from environments in the Middle East, Africa, and Central Asia. 7 multiplayer game modes supporting up to 32 players, with a focus on territorial control, destroying weapon caches and escorting high value targets. 5 cooperative game modes where you and your friends team up to complete mission-based objectives. Free content updates that include weapons, game modes, maps, and new features. Offline practice mode, playing with bots on all game modes. Squad system built upon role-based player classes, which are customizable and asymmetrical based on what team you are on. Squad-based communication system which includes 3D VOIP, allowing friendly and enemy players within proximity to hear you. Overhead map detailing objective and teammate locations. Accumulate supply to customize and upgrade your gear, affecting your weight, stamina, and movement speed. Simplified HUD and UI for a clean, immersive user experience focused on the action and environments. Highly immersive particle FX and audio to intensify the game experience. Create custom maps and content using the Insurgency SDK and scripting system, and share them on the Steam Workshop. Playable on PC, Mac OSX, and Linux with multiplayer cross-compatibility. Dedicated Server Support for PC and Linux. Multiplayer Game Modes: Push --- Three territorial objectives must be captured by the attacking team in sequential order. For each objective captured, they gain more reinforcement and time to attack the next. Defenders have a finite amount of reinforcements and must use each wisely. Once the third objective is captured by the attackers, a fourth cache objective must be destroyed, while the defenders have only one life to make a last stand. Firefight --- Three territorial objectives, one for each team, plus one neutral. Each team only respawns when they secure an objective. Secure all objectives or eliminate all enemy to win. Every life counts, making this a very suspenseful experience dependent upon teamwork. Skirmish --- In addition to three territorial objectives, each team has a supply cache to protect. Teams gain extra reinforcement waves until their cache is destroyed. When both teams have lost their caches and all reinforcement waves, it becomes a Firefight match. Occupy --- There is one central territorial objective in the area. The team that controls it does not deplete reinforcement waves. This gameplay in this mode is reminiscent to King of the Hill or ""tug of war"". Ambush --- A high value target (""HVT"") must be escorted to an extraction point. It's one team's goal to make this happen and it's the other team's goal to stop this from happening at all costs. The HVT is only armed with a silenced pistol, but can pick up a weapon from a fallen enemy or teammate. Strike --- Three weapon caches must be destroyed by the attacking team to achieve victory. Destroying a cache earns the attackers more reinforcements and time on the clock. The defenders must retain at least one cache from being destroyed and eliminate the enemy team once their reinforcements run dry. Infiltrate --- The standard Capture the Flag mode, but with a twist. Your team's goal is to take the enemy's intel and return it to your base. Your team will only gain reinforcements when someone takes the enemy's intel, or when an enemy stealing your team's intel is neutralized. This mode requires very strong team coordination and strategy. Flashpoint --- One neutral territorial objective and two caches on each side. The goal is to secure the entire area, controlling the middle and destroying the enemy's caches. Your team respawns when they secure the territorial objective or destroy a cache objective. Elimination --- In this single life mode, attackers must destroy one of two weapon caches, or eliminate the enemy team within the time limit. Defenders must kill all attackers. Cooperative Game Modes Checkpoint --- Complete mission-based objectives in sequence against AI enemy. Each successful objective will respawn anyone who was eliminated along the way. Hunt --- Insurgents are dispersed in the environment, and your squad must eliminate all targets while locating and destroying the weapons cache. High on tension, with only one-life. Survival --- Play as Insurgents and fight against endless waves of progressively difficult Security enemies on night themed maps. Reaching safehouse objectives with your team earns you supply to purchase better weapons and spawns any dead teammates. Outpost --- Defend your supply cache against endless waves of enemy trying to destroy it. Each successfully defended wave will bring in reinforcements of your teammates. Conquer --- Capture the objectives in the area and defend them from enemy trying to retake them. Destroy enemy weapon caches to thin out their numbers.",,"Minimum,OS:,Windows® 7,Processor:,Intel® Core™ 2 Duo E6600 or AMD Phenom™ X3 8750 processor or better,Memory:,4 GB RAM,Graphics:,Video card must be 512 MB or more and should be a DirectX 9-compatible with support for Pixel Shader 3.0,Hard Drive:,10 GB HD space,DirectX:,9.0c,Minimum,OS:,MacOS X 10.6.6 or higher,Processor:,Intel® Core i3 Processor (2GHz or better),Memory:,4 GB RAM,Graphics:,ATI Radeon HD 2400 or better / NVIDIA 8600M or better,Hard Drive:,10 GB HD space,Minimum,OS:,Ubuntu 12.04,Processor:,Dual core from Intel® or AMD at 2.8 GHz,Memory:,4 GB RAM,Graphics:,NVIDIA GeForce 8600/9600GT, ATI/AMD Radeon HD2600/3600 (Graphic Drivers: nVidia 310, AMD 12.11), OpenGL 2.1,Hard Drive:,10 GB available space,Sound Card:,OpenAL Compatible Sound Card","Recommended,Memory:,8 GB RAM,Graphics:,Video card 2048 MB or more,Hard Drive:,10 GB HD space on a SSD,Recommended,Processor:,Intel® Core i5 Processor (3GHz or better),Memory:,8 GB RAM,Graphics:,Video card 2048 MB or more,Hard Drive:,10 GB HD space on a SSD,Recommended,Memory:,8 GB RAM,Graphics:,Video card 2048 MB or more,Hard Drive:,10 GB HD space on a SSD",$29.98,$16.86

The first conflict saw the emergence of some incredible engines of war known as Mechs. Built by ""The Factory"", an independent city-state which has since become the object of everyone's desire, these technological monstrosities roam the snowy landscapes of Europa. Be the hero of one of the five factions – Saxony Empire, Crimean Khanate, Rusviet Union, Polania Republic or Nordic Kingdom – and become the richest and most powerful nation in all of Europa during these dark times! To assure the victory of your people, you will need to explore and conquer new territories, enlist new recruits and deploy your forces by building formidable and terrifying combat Mechs. Replay history in a fictional past full of mechanical engines and technology, where each choice you make will be critical. Choose your battles with care, because in Scythe, victory is achieved with and for the people! Asymmetry: every player starts the game with different resources (energy, coins, keen combat sense, popularity…), a different starting location and a secret objective. The starting positions are specifically set to contribute to the uniqueness of every faction and the asymmetrical nature of the game. Strategy: Scythe offers players almost complete control over their fate. The only elements of chance apart from each player's individual secrete objective card are the Encounter cards, which players draw to interact with the citizens of newly explored lands. Combat is also handled by way of choice; no luck or chance is involved. Engine Building: Players can improve their construction abilities to become more efficient, build structures that improve their position on the map, enlist new recruits into their faction, activate mechs to dissuade opponents from invading and expand their borders to reap greater types and quantities of resources. This aspect creates a feeling of energy and progression over the course of the entire game. The order in which players get to develop their economy and technologies adds to the unique feel of every game, even when playing as the same faction several times.

Every time you enter a new dungeon, your character's level will go back to 1, the layout of the dungeon will change, and the items you'll find on the ground will be different. Roguelikes are turn based, so every time you move one square or take an action (such as attacking), the enemies will each get one turn of their own. As long as you're standing still, the enemies will stay put, too. However, unlike a typical roguelike, the dungeons in Touhou Genso Wanderer Reloaded let you keep your items, even if you're defeated! So make sure to collect as many as you can! If roguelike games seem scary to you, don't worry! This game has a lot of options and systems to ensure your dungeon adventures turn out great! ･Intuitive Interface With a press of a button, you can bring up your Cross Menu, allowing you easy access to everything about your character you'll need. ･Changeable Game Speed You can choose between 3 different speeds for the game to run at, and change the speed at any time. Set your speed depending on your playstyle. ･UI Options You can change the size of the UI or the placement of the Mini-map to suit your needs. ""Main Story"" One day, a heavy rain poured down on Gensokyo. Reimu Hakurei looked for shelter in a shop called ""Kourindo,"" but all she found there was trouble. Rinnosuke Morichika, the owner of the shop, started acting strange and suddenly attacked her. Reimu's skills were no match for his newfound power, and she found herself on the ropes. She retreated back to her home, the Hakurei Shrine. Then, with the help of the sage, Kasen Ibaraki, she headed back to Kourindo to investigate the mysterious tower that had appeared there and bring Rinnosuke back to his senses. Now the curtains rise on a new incident to threaten Gensokyo, the battle over the Gold Sphere. ""Your favorite Touhou Characters"" Jam-packed with over 120 different friends and foes from the world of Touhou, this game may be the biggest Touhou banquet yet!

Can you build the ultimate optimised, free-flowing car production line whilst beating the competition and still turn a profit? A modern car factory is a near perfect example of efficiency, process-management and flow. A massive army of precision-controlled robots dance to a milimeter-perfect ballet of engineering excellence with perfect timing. Components snake along conveyor belts to a 'just-in-time' ordering system that leaves no pauses, no delay, no confusion or congestion. Nothing exists but the perfect flowing efficiency of high tech car construction... ...in theory. In practice, of course, life is not so simple. When you get to grips with your first factory design, it certainly will not feel in a state of pure flow...or profit for that matter. Making a handful of built-to-order cars and breaking even is one thing...but competing with the big multinationals and churning out thousands of cars for the mass market is a whole new ballgame. To win market share from the big companies you are going to need planning, an appreciation of future technology, a careful eye on your bottom line, and an ability to design a factory layout that makes use of every square meter, and cuts production costs per car to the absolute minimum. Have you got what it takes to win? Production line is the new car factory management/simulation/tycoon game from Positech Games, the developers of Democracy & Gratuitous Space Battles, and publishers of Big Pharma. This game is designed to appeal to the efficiency geek in all of us, the person who cannot help but organize things for maximum performance. The closet entrepreneur, the stats-geek,  Is that you? if so...welcome to your dream game (we hope!) The key to understanding production line is the division of labor and the merits of purpose-built machinery. At the start, your factory will be small and the individual slots on your production line will carry out large complex tasks (like fitting the car body). As you research better methods, and earn the funds to expand, you will continue to subdivide those slots into smaller (and faster) production areas which keep the flow of new vehicles flowing smoothly. At the same time, product design researchers will be working out how to enhance your cars with new technologies such as automatic headlights, power steering, bluetooth phone support and voice recognition. its a race to be productive AND a race to be profitable.

Everything from, Roman Centurions, Medieval soldiers, Knights, Orcs, Trolls, and yes, chickens! The main focus in this game is giving the player no restrictions to what he can do.

On top of that, you can play as any one of the units in the game, getting up close and personal to help change the tides of a massive battle, while rallying teammates and giving them orders!  The Technology:  Unfortunately there really aren't many engines that you can chuck 10,000 characters in and expect good performance. This is why I worked months on end to create the most powerful crowd rendering system ever conceived in Unity engine. The detail of each character has little effect on performance while each individual acts independently, but is working towards a greater good for his team.  Each individual decides his own path and navigates complex environments. But I didn't stop there! With the large open environments, I needed a more dynamic lighting solution than the one built in to Unity engine. So I built my own dynamic global illumination lighting engine. This enables bounce light completely in real time. What does that mean?

FEATURES: Huge map Physics-based EVERYTHING Unit Customization FAQ Why are you making a battle royale game?! TABG is an April Fools' joke, we’ve done one every year since 2016. We've previously combined one of our games with another genre or game. The first year we made Supertruck, a mix between the game Superhot and Clustertruck. Last year we made TABZ which is a mix of TABS and DAY-Z. We spend an enormous amount of lunch breaks and nights playing battle royale games, this is an homage to a genra we love. Why are you making another game? Shouldn't you be working on TABS? We didn’t take much time away from TABS, we took some time to work on TABG because we wanted to bring you something while you wait for TABS. We knew that TABZ last year, and Supertruck the year before was very appreciated by our community and thought we’d keep up the tradition by making yet another game for you to play. Why are you releasing it in June and not April? We had some networking issues but were determined to finish up the game to share it with you all!",,"Minimum:,OS:,Win 7,Processor:,Intel Core i5-2400 @ 3.1 GHz or AMD FX-6300 @ 3.5 GHz or equivalent,Memory:,8 GB RAM,Graphics:,NVIDIA GeForce GTX 670 or AMD R9 270 (2GB VRAM with Shader Model 5.0 or better),DirectX:,Version 9.0c,Network:,Broadband Internet connection,Storage:,6 GB available space,Additional Notes:,Only runs on 64 bit systems","Recommended:,OS:,Win 10,Processor:,Intel Core i7-4770 @ 3.4 GHz or AMD Ryzen 5 1600 @ 3.2 GHz or equivalent,Memory:,8 GB RAM,Graphics:,NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970 or AMD R9 290X (4GB VRAM with Shader Model 5.0 or better),DirectX:,Version 9.0c,Network:,Broadband Internet connection,Additional Notes:,Only runs on 64 bit systems",$4.99,

With war raging and the planet under siege by the armies of greedy Ork warlord Gorgutz, ambitious Eldar seer Macha, and mighty Space Marine commander Gabriel Angelos, supremacy must ultimately be suspended for survival. UNLEASH THE GIANTS Take control of towering war machines and tip the balance of battle in your favor with the biggest characters in Dawn of War history. Turn the tide with the mighty Imperial Knight (Space Marine), the clattering Gorkanaut (Ork), or the haunting Wraithknight (Eldar).

You'll soon come to understand the combat advantages of Space Marines, Orks, and Eldar and the rules of a universe with no heroes or villains… only war.

The world is in chaos after a prototype combat robot - banned by law and awaiting secure destruction by XERA Corporation - became self-aware, escaped and began replication on an industrial scale. Failed attempts to remotely shut down the AI simply triggered a war that humanity could not afford to lose.  Nation turned on nation in a fight for control over resources to defend against the robots. With the attention of the world’s military elsewhere, disenfranchised operatives have gathered to ransack what was left of the XERA facilities, setting up two forward operating bases, safe zones on each side of the forest that was the hiding place for mankind’s greatest failure of leadership.  Between these bases there are no rules of engagement, as for some, nothing less than the future of the human race is at stake; for some there is a potentially boundless paycheck; and for others perhaps, political leverage. For all, the only imperative is survival.  But then again, no one expected the robots to be waiting. MULTIPLAYER WITH PERSISTENT GLOBAL INVENTORY  XERA: Survival has been built from the ground up as a multiplayer game you can play with your friends or against others from all around the world - the choice is yours. Store your gear safely in a persistent global inventory. Log out from an American server, and access all your items on a European server. Venture out on raids using your selected load-out with friends, or meet players from all over the world! We have servers operating in North America, South America, Europe, Asia and Oceania. Communication is important in any multiplayer game. Whether you're screaming “I’m friendly!” or taunting your enemies - you will be heard. With directional support, you can pinpoint where the voice is coming from. PLAYER VS PLAYER VS ENVIRONMENT Venture out in search of glory, revenge, salvation, leverage - or hard cash. Scavenge for weapons, ammo, food and water, medical supplies; craft the tools you need to survive a harsh and unforgiving forest environment. Deploy drones to scout, transport – or close the business a bullet left unfinished. And when you’re ready to stash your loot – just make it back alive to either of the safe forward operating bases. CHOOSE YOUR OWN PACE (FARM OR FIGHT!) Use the cover of darkness to avoid PvP combat, build your resources and focus on PvE takedowns to scavenge the best loot. In the base you can trade safely with other players, or save to your server-side stash. Alternatively, you can choose to tool up and raid as a lone wolf or teamed with buddies, dropping where you want in the 4x4km world using regular helicopter insertions from the bases or on foot. Take part in giant PvPvE compound events or missions you pick up from NPCs back in the base. And all the while, lose just the equipment you brought with you in the event you meet an untimely death. DYNAMIC DAY / NIGHT AND WEATHER SYSTEMS  The day and night cycle in XERA: Survival adds variation to game play. In darkness, it’s easier to avoid other players and scavenge the best loot. But beware, different robot variations come out at night – faster and harder to kill. Weigh up your choices carefully…  A realistic weather system has been implemented which adds further dynamic elements to combat and survival. Your tactics will need to change depending on the weather conditions. LIVE LONGER AND PROSPER  Earn XP in game from looting, participating in events, killing robots and so on. Levelling up unlocks enhanced skills, for example inflicting more PvE damage or being harder to spot by robots. You can gain improved medical treatment abilities or even drone buffs, besides opening up new recipes for crafting and an increased stash size. TOOLS OF THE TRADE  Weapons you can uncover in XERA: Survival include sniper rifles, a range of assault rifles and submachine guns, plus pistols and course their ammo. Medical supplies, backpacks, food and drink all play important roles – and of course many items can be crafted from looted material. Drones – what’s not to like? They can be used for a range of purposes, and have upgrade paths as your skills improve.  The world's loot system constantly spawns fresh gear around the map, so roaming is your best option for finding more equipment. Just make sure you make it back to one of the bases… COMMUNITY DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT  Following an extended open Alpha period, XERA: Survival is now entering Early Access. We are committed to a fair business model for our players – you won’t find us selling bullets or introducing any punitive monetization. Cosmetic upgrades can be earned in game and may be purchasable via in-game transactions. XERA: Survival is developed by Spotted Kiwi Interactive, an independent development company based in the deep south of New Zealand (Aotearoa) with team members around the world. We have a community-focused development ethos and though we have a clear vision for the game through Early Access, we will always be open to suggestions from our players."," Mature Content Description  The developers describe the content like this:  Violence, Alcohol References  ","Minimum:,Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system,OS:,64-bit Windows 7, Windows 8.1, Windows 10,Processor:,Intel Core i3-4340 / AMD FX-6300,Memory:,8 GB RAM,Graphics:,nVidia GeForce GTX 660 2GB / AMD Radeon HD 7850 2GB,DirectX:,Version 11,Network:,Broadband Internet connection,Storage:,20 GB available space","Recommended:,Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system,OS:,64-bit Windows 7, Windows 8.1, Windows 10,Processor:,Intel Core i5-6600K / AMD Ryzen 5 1600,Memory:,8 GB RAM,Graphics:,NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 3GB / AMD Radeon RX 580 4GB,DirectX:,Version 11,Network:,Broadband Internet connection,Storage:,20 GB available space",$19.99,

Command a flying steam locomotive The only thing between you and the waste-winds, storms and cosmic lightning is your engine. Tend and upgrade it, buy weaponry and exotic equipment, and keep her hull in good shape to hold the hostile Heavens at bay. Explore a unique and dangerous universe You play the captain of a locomotive, a steam engine fitted for off-rail travel: sailing the stars, leading your crew into trouble and out of their minds. Smuggle souls, barter for crates of time, stop for cricket and a cup of tea. Discover more of the deep, dark and marvellous Fallen London Universe, as seen in our previous game, Sunless Sea. (You can play either game first, the stories coexist happily.) Fight her majesty's agents, pirates and abominations of the skies Face ships of differing factions and unknowable beasts each with different attacks and agendas. Survive starvation, madness and terror. Manage your crew’s condition and your captain’s nightmares. Balance fuel and supplies against your desire for new horizons, knowledge or riches. Struggle with sights never meant for human eyes. How will the dark change you? Recruit officers on your adventures Populate your ship with unique, upgradeable officers, each with their own quest to fulfill: an incautious driver, an incognito princess, a repentant devil, and - dear god! - your Aunt?! How did she get out here? Discover your captain’s past through narrative levelling Reveal your captain’s past deeds as facets of their personality as you progress. Most captains will perish, but their actions will leave a mark on the world for their descendants - for better or worse. Pass on some effects, and return anew to deal with events that your previous captain put into motion. The World The High Wilderness is a wondrous vision of space: shifting, wind-swept ruins where the laws of the cosmos are not as we imagined. The stars are alive. They are the Judgements: vast intelligences that govern all things. But they are dying. One by one, something is snuffing them out, leaving their thrones empty. Unfettered by trivial things like gravity, the Victorian Empire have pushed their tendrils into this new world, and their ambition is savage. They have built a new Sun. The Empress Victoria reigns from the Throne of Hours, which gives her control over time. Your Captain and crew must carve out a life between the stars. Will you support her majesty and the establishment, or the working class rebels who yearn for freedom from the Workworlds? Features Multiple, intertwining stories with a depth and richness unlike anything else in games, inspired by CS Lewis, Jules Verne, Lovecraft and HG Wells Lush, hand-drawn 2d art Four regions to explore: celestial wilderness, impossible industrial empire, pagan midnight expanse, and the mysterious Blue Kingdom A choice of play styles: build a lineage of captains as each dies, or reload your most recent captain and continue Key remapping and full controller support Who are Failbetter Games?

If you want to know more about that, please read the Early Access disclaimer at the top of the page. Several hundred years ago, a cataclysmic catastrophe nearly ripped your galaxy apart - an insurmountable ring of torn hyperspace fabric appeared in the center of the galaxy, which normal hyperspace engines can’t overcome. Since this event nobody has managed to get near the central regions of the galaxy. All you know is that this event also spawned multiple insurmountable hyperspace rifts throughout the entire galaxy, and that a strange race of aliens, the Xsotan, has appeared in the center. It looks like these aliens have found a way to surpass the torn hyperspace fabric, but so far nobody has managed to establish contact with them. There are also rumors about a strange new metal called ‘Avorion’, which has appeared in the center of the galaxy, around the same time as the Xsotan arrived. Apparently the aliens use this material to build their ships. Start out as a nobody at the edge of the galaxy and work your way to the center of a galaxy that gets more dangerous, but also more rewarding the closer you get to its core. Avorion takes sandbox aspects from games like X or Freelancer, throws in co-op multiplayer and lets you build your own ships. It features ships made of freely scalable blocks that can be procedurally generated and that break into pieces where they're hit in space fights. Combat Equip your ship with chainguns, lasers and other weaponry to take on your enemies and enjoy the sight of completely destructible ships breaking at the exact points where you hit them. Defend your allies from pirates, hunt down enemies for coin or even participate in wars between entire factions. Build hangars and command squads of fighters in your battles or destroy enemy freighters to steal their cargo. Explore Fly through beautiful nebulas and dense asteroid fields in search of hidden treasures and meet the many factions that populate and control their portion of the galaxy. Each faction has its own characteristics, such as peaceful, intelligent or aggressive, and has its own ship styles, meaning their ships and stations have a distinct look. Explore the galaxy at your own pace to find valuable goods in old ship wreckages, undiscovered asteroid fields rich of resources, unchartered asteroids which you can claim for yourself, or clues as to what happened during the event a few hundred years back. Build Your Fleet There are no limits to ship size or complexity besides your resources. You're not bound to the standard voxel style and while building an awesome ship in Avorion you won't get lost in lots and lots of micro-management. You can focus on building a great looking ship, without having too much trouble to make it work. But make sure you still keep an eye on your ship’s maneuverability and energy requirements. Adjust your ships perfectly to their operational purpose by building light and agile or heavily armored ships. Build specialized transport ships with lots of cargo space or heavily armored battleships with strong shields. Collect loot from defeated foes which you can use to upgrade your ship: New turrets, resources, trading goods or system upgrades. Install system upgrades that allow more weapons, ease asteroid mining or trading systems which detect trading routes over multiple sectors. And why build only one ship? Hire captains to fly your ships for you, manage your crews, weapons, hangars and fighters and build your own fleet of space ships! Trade Extend your ship with a cargo bay, find profitable deals and haul over a hundred trading goods through the galaxy to make a profit and buy your way up the food chain: Build up a trading corporation and extend your influence in the galaxy by founding asteroid mines and factories that attract NPC traders who will buy and sell their goods at your establishments. Co-op Multiplayer You don't have to fight the galaxy alone! Avorion features co-op multiplayer, so team up with your friends to build stations together and destroy pirates and enemy factions! Work together to extend your influence in the galaxy and build your own empire. Or, you know, blow them apart in large PvP battles. It's a sandbox, you can do whatever you want. In Avorion you choose your personal playstyle. Haul cargo, find profitable trading routes and found factories. Or maybe you're sick of being the good guy? Build your own battleship, equip it with powerful weaponry and blow away your enemies. Be the aggressor that starts wars with entire factions, raid freighters, smuggle illegal goods and scavenge old wreckages. Find your way to the center of a galaxy that gets more hostile, but also more rewarding the closer you get to its core.",,"Minimum:,Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system,OS:,Windows 7 or higher,Processor:,Dual Core CPU,Memory:,4 GB RAM,Graphics:,A graphics device that supports OpenGL 3.0 or higher.,Network:,Broadband Internet connection,Storage:,600 MB available space,Minimum:,Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system,OS:,Ubuntu 12.04 or higher,Processor:,Dual Core CPU,Memory:,4 GB RAM,Graphics:,A graphics device that supports OpenGL 3.0 or higher.,Network:,Broadband Internet connection,Storage:,600 MB available space","Recommended:,Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system,OS:,Windows 7 or higher,Processor:,Quad Core CPU,Memory:,6 GB RAM,Graphics:,A graphics device that supports OpenGL 4.5.,Network:,Broadband Internet connection,Storage:,1 GB available space,Recommended:,Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system,OS:,Ubuntu 12.04 or higher,Processor:,Quad Core CPU,Memory:,6 GB RAM,Graphics:,A graphics device that supports OpenGL 4.5.,Network:,Broadband Internet connection,Storage:,1 GB available space",$17.99,

Dark forces the likes of which have never been seen before are amassing to tear the souls from those too weak to resist and devour whoever is left. Fling spells and swing metal, rush enemies and crush bones, and in the end, pry their weapons from their cold, unworthy hands. Carve a path through your enemies in your quest for glory in Pagan Online. An epic setting based on Slavic mythology – the stuff of legends Set in a striking realm rich with lore and history, Pagan Online is based off various Slavic myths and sagas. We’ve drawn from this seemingly endless fount to create a distinct flavour and a whole new world for fans of epic fantasy to immerse themselves in. Tales of larger than life heroes, endangered deities, and shattered sanctity await you in Pagan Online. It’s dangerous to go alone Will you vanquish your foes lone wolf style, or team up with a friend to take on the biggest and baddest monsters? You can choose to play all levels alone or play game modes designed for more than one person. You can meet other players to fight alongside you in the Pantheon, a social hub for heroes approved by the Gods themselves. Crush without mercy At its core, Pagan Online is a game of dynamic and fast-paced action. You will experience gameplay that is responsive, fast, and satisfying – and nothing’s more satisfying than crushing, slicing, and smashing your way through hordes of enemies in a brutal and mesmerizing display of quick thinking and skill. It is easy to pick up but difficult to master – a good thing to keep in mind after your 108th death. As you become more battle-hardened, your renown grows and doors open for you – both to greater power and greater foes. A class for every player, a hero for every taste These aren’t just your typical RPG classes! The playable characters in Pagan Online are inspired by old folks’ tales and stories our grandmothers used to tell us when we were kids. From nomad knights to beastly abominations, they are familiar and yet like nothing you’ve ever tried before. Every hero has their own abilities, playstyles, and their own weapons and attacks, so you could be forgiven for thinking you’re playing a different game when you take up arms as another hero. Carry out devastating combos with skills in your repertoire and do whatever it takes to come out on top – leech the blood of your downed foes to stay standing, summon the might of Perun himself in a thunderfist, or channel the elements to unleash raw destruction. Your hero, your style If you’re going to be looking at your hero constantly, you might as well look at something nice. A hero is a hero no matter what they wear of course, but you gotta admit, the deep red of a blood spatter would look so fetching on your green robes. You can pick from a wide variety of class-specific armor sets for each hero. Not only can you upgrade and customize heroes to your liking, but you can also use unique skins and shaders so the enemy commanders will know exactly who is coming to end them. Wield weapons of legend Action RPGs can’t work without loot. We all love it and your enemies love to drop it. Pagan Online takes it up a notch with a unique crafting system in which you can create a weapon tailor-made for you and how you prefer to play.

It is meant to be an open creation platform so everybody can make their own characters, backgrounds or props and import them into FaceRig. (More on http://facerig.com ) FaceRig is being developed by Holotech Studios and the image-based face tracking SDK being used is provided by ULSee Inc. To find out more about ULSee Inc., visit http://ulsee.com or email them at info@ulsee.com . Our previous tracking technology was provided by Visage Technologies. FaceRig has three versions: FaceRig Classic is the base version of FaceRig, which allows for home non-profit use and even limited monetization on YouTube/Twitch or similar as long as the commercial aspect of it is not significant. We consider commercially significant using it on any avenue (channel) that produces you more than $500 monthly revenue. This includes ad-based revenue and voluntary donations (one time or recurrent such as a Patreon). If you are under this threshold you can use Classic, if you are above you need to upgrade to Pro or Studio. the FaceRig Pro DLC, which allows you to monetize videos on YouTube/Twitch regardless of the monthly revenue, but not for content exclusive to paid/subscription based services, such as the new YouTube Red (for content that is exclusive to YouTube Red or similar you will need FaceRig Studio). FaceRig Pro does not bring new assets, technical features or improvements to FaceRig Classic. For more details, take a look at the Pro DLC description the Studio Version allows commercial use, as well as  access to the expression mo-cap data. For more details about this version visit http://facerig.com We believe that FaceRig will entertain many gamers, modelling and animation artists, members of various fandoms, streamers, web casters, YouTubers and their audiences. For now we're focusing on just tracking and rendering the portrait with its expressions, but we aim to do more in the future. The FaceRig end goal is to provide a full featured real time digital actor set for home use. Key Features: Real time head and expression tracking in an input video stream, (also with audio analysis). Combining tracked data with additional virtual puppeteering input. On-the-fly animation re-targeting for the tracked data and applying the animation on a user selected 3d model, with audio processing (voice alteration) Rendering and lighting the animated model in real time, in a user selected background. Encoding the rendered video and sending it further as output from a virtual webcam (it basically intercepts webcam input, and swaps the images captured by your real webcam with the fantastic content before sending it further). Provide the interface for tuning the parameters of all operations above. Customizable avatars. To see the complete list on FaceRig avatars including the ones from DLC's please see: https://facerig.com/tips/tuesday-tips-0-avatar-list/ Open creation platform: you can make your own models (outside of FaceRig), import and use them as your avatars. The models need to be created according to  a set of published specs. Notes: Numeric export of the tracked expression data (exporting the motion capture data to use in other applications) is a feature reserved for the Studio version. FaceRig  Classic and Pro only output already rendered video and audio. FaceRig is an indie initiative, and its development so far has been successfully crowd-funded through Indiegogo.

Every night, everyone in town gets out of bed and sleepwalks. In the morning, they wake up with no recollection of what happened or where they were. IT TOOK YOUR FRIEND. THEY SAY IT'S NOT REAL Some teenagers in this town woke up during a few of these ""Blackouts"" themselves, finding themselves in the woods or on train tracks with no idea how they got there. When they tell their parents, their teachers, the police... no one believes them. Taking matters into their own hands, they formed a club - The Blackout Club - to get to the bottom of it. Unfortunately, the recent disappearance of a close friend means that the sleepwalking isn't just strange - it could be deadly. IT WALKS AMONG THEM You and your friends must team up to overcome the powerful forces that are arrayed against you. Using tools such as drones, noisemakers, and grappling hooks, you will outwit and outmaneuver the adults while attempting to obtain and record evidence that will prove what is happening to the rest of the world. With procedural elements that change goals, enemies, loot and more, no two nights in the neighborhood will be the same. Gameplay Features A Modern Horror Setting To Explore: A beautiful and modern neighborhood full of houses, woods, and a very mysterious subterranean network of tunnels. Cooperative Gameplay: Drop-in/Drop-out multiplayer sessions for 1-4 players. Each Night A New Adventure: Missions are procedurally-generated and vary according to player level and progress. Enemy Patrols, Loot Placement, Mission Objectives, Environmental Obstacles, and other aspects of each night's mission are never the same twice for a high amount of replayability. Richly-Simulated World Supporting Many Play Styles: Players have the freedom to go through the game at their own pace and choose the paths they take through the world. Experiment with different abilities and items to find creative solutions to any problem. A Deep Mystery Under The Surface: Though we are a small team, we have decades of AAA experience from before we went independent, and our last game The Magic Circle has won awards for its story and narrative. That being said... with The Blackout Club , we have a few new tricks up our sleeve we think are going to surprise even the most veteran horror game fans. Character Growth & Customization: Players get to create their own character and customize them by unlocking new clothing, gestures, and hairstyles. As players level up they will also unlock new expansion slots and upgrade their abilities. An Unseen Threat: If players are not careful and draw too much attention to themselves, The Shape will come for them. You'll need to stick together and look out for one another while it hunts you down. There's one catch... You can only see The Shape by closing your eyes . TOGETHER, WE CAN FIND HER.

The game provides an experience of war seen from an entirely new angle. The pace of This War of Mine is imposed by the day and night cycle. During the day snipers outside stop you from leaving your refuge, so you need to focus on maintaining your hideout: crafting, trading and taking care of your survivors. At night, take one of your civilians on a mission to scavenge through a set of unique locations for items that will help you stay alive. Make life-and-death decisions driven by your conscience. Try to protect everybody from your shelter or sacrifice some of them for longer-term survival. During war, there are no good or bad decisions; there is only survival. The sooner you realize that, the better. This War of Mine: Anniversary Edition It's been two years since This War of Mine global release and we're still expanding the experience. This new free DLC, created especially for the Anniversary Edition, adds new characters, new locations to explore, and most importantly - a whole new ending, leading to a different outcome to the game. The dilemma though remains the same – how far will you go, to protect the ones you care about? This War of Mine: Inspired by real-life events Control your survivors and manage your shelter Craft weapons, alcohol, beds or stoves – anything that helps you survive Make decisions - an often unforgiving and emotionally difficult experience Randomized world and characters every time you start a new game Charcoal-stylized aesthetics to complement the game's theme IGN This War of Mine might be the war game we need. Gamespot I was intrigued by This War of Mine's attempts to portray the consequences of war in a way that games have largely ignored in the past. The fact that the psychological and emotional challenges of living under such horrifying conditions are something you have to consider as you struggle gives me added hope that it might treat its hefty and important subject matter with the gravity and complexity that it deserves. Game Informer 11bit is blazing a new thematic trail amidst the currently popular survival genre, and so far the studio seems to have something special on its hand.

Campfire Games is devoted to presenting the gruesome and glorious elements of the period, while maintaining the highest level of historical accuracy and realism as is possible with the wonders of CRYENGINE. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ - Massive battles: Take part in engagements consisting of 150 players. - Tailored for line formation teamplay: Custom formation buff mechanic system rewards sticking together by lessening the suppression effects, the morale cost for the team when dying and the flag bearer respawn rate. - Historical accuracy: Period correct uniforms, weapons, manual of arms animations, battlefields, objectives & drill camps. - Regimental pride: 95 researched and recreated regiments all supporting uniforms for all ranks (Private to Colonel) and player classes. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ - Immersive communication: In-game 3D voice system. - Recreated battlefields: More than 30 historically accurate skirmish areas of the Battles of Antietam and South Mountain as well as the Siege of Harpers Ferry to play on and three drill camps to perfect your formation forming abilities or simply exchange battle stories at the campfire. - Player classes: Private, NCO, Flag Bearer & Officer playable from every regiment featured and covering all ranks from Private to Colonel. - Community focus: A strong company (player organized clans) focus with a dedicated company tool and forum sections devoted to in-game event creation. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ - Powerful game engine: Powered by CRYENGINE V, War of Rights is capable of providing visuals unmatched by any other Civil War game. - More than a game: War of Rights is a vision that keeps expanding its scale. The project is entirely crowdfunded and has been developed on for the past 6 years. We consider it more of an ever evolving artistic piece rather than a final product with a targeted release deadline with set features. Players in the game will be able to play on multiple battlefields of the campaign, from the confluence of the Potomac and Shenandoah Rivers where the Siege of Harper's Ferry took place, to the ridgelines of South Mountain, and to the meandering waters of Antietam Creek at the Battle of Antietam. Additionally, players will also be able to choose from a list of regiments that fought in each battle as well as what rank to fight as, whether they want to slog it out as a lowly private, or if you want to orchestrate the carnage and mayhem as a major general. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ Uniforms and bodily features will all be customizable for other players to see as you march and fight in the lines of battle according to the tactics of the period. As a General, you will operate in your headquarters equipped with a map of the battlefield and constantly receiving reports of friendly and enemy positions. Send out new orders to the regiments to move forward, or fall back - all in real time. The orders will move down the chain of command, to the Colonels, Majors, down to the Captains in charge of the individual regiments, all of whom have the option to follow the orders of their trusted commander, or rebel against his wishes and fight as you see fit. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ Each map contains a period reconstruction of the buildings, farms, forests, roads, and rocks as they were in 1862 so players can fight through the streets of Harper's Ferry, in the wooded heights of Fox's Gap at South Mountain, or in the cornfields and Bloody Lanes of Antietam. Players can feel the whiz of deadly shot and shell fly by their bodies, or hit their comrades or themselves as they scream in a bloody hail from their wounds. Limbs will fly and blood will be spilt once again as Campfire Games brings the fighting of the Civil War right to the player's computer screen! ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ Will you heed the Union call against the traitors? Or will you fight to defend your family and livelihood with the Confederacy? You decide! ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ We thought it a good idea to recreate/repost our Early Access roadmap as a lot of players having joined us recently are unlikely to know what we are intending to offer as the game advances in its development. The below roadmap should be taken for what it is - a preliminary list of things we have planned for. As all plans are subject to change, there is a great chance that the list will also end up changing, however. The order of the roadmap is also subject to change as the development moves ahead. Some things listed may arrive a great deal sooner or later than what their listing order indicates. 1. Bug fixes, stability improvements: This will be an ongoing focus throughout the development of the game. An alpha is never without its bugs. New content rarely comes without its fair share of bugs and issues required to fix up. 2. Performance improvements: We are well aware of the performance of the alpha is needing to be improved - especially at higher playercounts. Major programming work is currently going into reworking the most expensive part of the game at high playercounts. Once finished you should all be experiencing much better framerates on populated servers. 3. Expanded server moderation tools: This will allow server administrators more control to manage and configure their server using commands such as: kick,ban,change map, change skirmish area, change weather and time of day. 4. End game events: Taken out just before the launch on Early Access, the end game events will be making a comeback in a more fleshed out form, specifically designed to create more memorable end game moments in cases where the question of who were the winners of the match is heavily contested. 5. Improved melee: Melee is going to be receiving a much needed overhaul, including the availability of a parry move and animation kill sequences between two players (“kill-moves”) to increase the visual fidelity of close quarter fighting. 6. New battlefields: The Battles of South Mountain and Shepherdstown will eventually complete the Maryland Campaign of 1862. 7. Fleshed out officer order system: Additional officer commands will be introduced to allow for a greater range of tactical options. 8. Musicians: Working in tandem with the officer order system, musicians will have to relay the correct calls to help make sure the orders are received down the line. 9. Historical Battles mode: Besides the quicker Skirmish mode, the largest and main game mode intended for the game, known as Historical Battles, would open up the entirety of the 4x4 km battlefields for more of a complete playthrough, with a moving frontline consisting of several capture areas. This will also entail the use of the full chain of command where players take the part of Generals, using maps and couriers to direct troops across the huge battlefield. 10. Player controlled artillery: The many batteries already placed on the battlefields will become player controlled once we introduce an artillery system, where players will have access to some of the most destructive and tide-turning weapons of war. 11. Generals: The chain of command on the battlefield will be expanded with the addition of generals. Generals bring a tactical overview to the battle that all other classes lack, helping to command the troops when using the historical battles mode, helping to bring some order to the chaos of war. 12. Cavalry: Horses are to be implemented for both cavalry units, moving artillery pieces, as well as for the high command and their couriers. The cavalry was still an important branch of the armies of the period considering the changes in technology, acting as reconnaissance and quick response units as understandings for their use developed over the period of the war. 13. Final Release: Once the above features have been finished, we will be at the point that we would be just about ready for full release of the game to all and sundry! This final release would also be the point that those that had backed us originally would be getting their promised physical and digital goods. While we cannot give any definite date as to when we might get to release, we inch closer every day!"," Mature Content Description  The developers describe the content like this:  War of Rights aims to portray Civil War period fighting.

NOW. By taking the suspense, challenge and visceral charge of the original, and adding startling new realism and responsiveness, Half-Life 2 opens the door to a world where the player's presence affects everything around him, from the physical environment to the behaviors even the emotions of both friends and enemies. The player again picks up the crowbar of research scientist Gordon Freeman, who finds himself on an alien-infested Earth being picked to the bone, its resources depleted, its populace dwindling. Freeman is thrust into the unenviable role of rescuing the world from the wrong he unleashed back at Black Mesa. And a lot of people he cares about are counting on him. The intense, real-time gameplay of Half-Life 2 is made possible only by Source®, Valve's new proprietary engine technology. Source provides major enhancements in:   Characters: Advanced facial animation system delivers the most sophisticated in-game characters ever seen. With 40 distinct facial ""muscles,"" human characters convey the full array of human emotion, and respond to the player with fluidity and intelligence.  Physics: From pebbles to water to 2-ton trucks respond as expected, as they obey the laws of mass, friction, gravity, and buoyancy.  Graphics: Source's shader-based renderer, like the one used at Pixar to create movies such as Toy Story® and Monster's, Inc.®, creates the most beautiful and realistic environments ever seen in a video game.  AI: Neither friends nor enemies charge blindly into the fray. They can assess threats, navigate tricky terrain, and fashion weapons from whatever is at hand.  ",,,,$9.99,$65.70

DISCLAIMER (PLEASE READ): The public Early Access is intended for those interested in supporting the project and participating in it's continued development. You will most likely experience balancing issues, performance issues, bugs and missing features. If you are looking for a complete gaming experience, I would recommend allowing some time before trying out the game. There are many YouTube game-plays showing the current state of game. I am the sole developer of the project, which I work  on in my spare time as a passion project. I feel this is important to mention, so that those considering playing the game can make a more informed purchase decision. A full detailed list of the updates since launch can be viewed here: http://steamcommunity.com/app/418030/allnews/ . Goals of the project: The aim is to integrate the kinds of base-resource micro-management typically found in RTS titles, into a boots-on-the-ground shooter.

Paranormal Activity Helpers Incorporated, yeah sounds corny, but the pay is great. They said you won't ever be in any real danger, and they have tons of work right now. Your first job is at some old haunted house. There is a broker wanting to put the house for sale, but with everyone in the town spreading rumors of evil living inside the house, he needs some proof that it is safe. He actually seems creeped out himself. Anyway, he hired PAH Inc. to check the place out. You can go check it out alone if you'd like, but I would take at least 3 more friends with me. Check the place out, and if there is anything supernatural going on, try to bring evidence back to PAH Inc. MYSTERY OF THE HOUSE This house was built over 100 years ago. The owners ran a funeral parlor. They held normal funeral services such as ceremonies, wakes, cremation and burying the dead. The rumor around town is that they also offered a very special service, a way to talk to your deceased loved one on last time. Several people paid for the service, and after some type of ritual, they were able to speak to the dead. Something apparently went wrong during one of the rituals. A person from town and the owners of the house disappeared and were never seen again. Over the last century, a few people that investigated the incident never returned. A few kids sneaking around the place claimed to hear laughter and see a little girl in the window. There probably isn't any truth to any of it. GAMEPLAY In Pacify, you will be running for your life around the narrow corridors of a dark, old house. There is a little girl that switches between good and evil roaming around. Different circumstances can cause her to change. Once the evil takes over, it will chase you and your friends all over the house. You must find a way to Pacify the evil and escape the house. As the game progresses, the evil gets smarter and faster. Play alone in single player mode, or play with up to 3 more friends in multiplayer. In multiplayer mode, you can choose to play with or against your friends. Read the notes for clues about Pacifying the girl. Find and use keys, dolls, wood and matches to help you on your way. The girl can hear and see you. Stay out of sight, and stay as quiet as possible. Try different types of strategies to win. Single Player Mode You can go in the house alone, but the game will be difficult. You must do the work of 2-4 people all by yourself. It is possible though and very scary to take on the girl all alone! Co-Op Mode In co-op multiplayer, you work together trying to help each other escape the house. You can save each other from the girl by interrupting her when she catches someone. PVP Mode In pvp mode, everyone is an intern for PAH Inc. vying to get a full time position. The person that does the most work gets hired. You can push each other down and get in each other's way. Pushing a player on the floor stuns them for 5 seconds and causes them to drop their keys.

New side story episodes will also be added for returning characters. [The New Visuals] With the help of a new graphics engine, DOA6 aims to bring visual entertainment of fighting games to an entirely new level. The graphics are made to be both enticingly beautiful and realistic, bringing out enhanced facial expressions, such special effects as depiction of sweat and dirt on character models, and realistic hit effects.

[Break Blow] A strong, high-damage special move that knocks your opponents down. The first part of the move also parries incoming attacks, working as both an offensive and defensive move! [Break Hold] A convenient counter technique that can also be used while the player is heavily stunned. It should only be used in tight situations due to its light-damage output. [Fatal Rush] A powerful combo with a dramatic finishing move, activated by consecutively pressing the [RB] button. While it is made to be easy to use for beginner players, it can also be employed in more than one creative way by the experienced competitors. [New Danger Zones] [Rumble Danger] If knocked into onlookers, they will push the player back into the center of the stage. It is a trap that combines the atmosphere of a real street fight with strategy. [Mass-Destruction] If the opponent is knocked back into a large stack of boxes or barrels with a “Break Blow” or ”Fatal Rush” it will cause a large chain-explosion. This will lead to a huge burst of damage and produces an exhilarating rush."," Mature Content Description  The developers describe the content like this:  This Game may contain content not appropriate for all ages, or may not be appropriate for viewing at work: Frequent Violence or Gore, Partial Nudity, Sexual Content  ","Minimum:,Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system,OS:,Windows 10 （64bit）,Processor:,Intel Core i5-4690 or over,Memory:,8 GB RAM,Graphics:,NVIDIA GeForce GTX 770,DirectX:,Version 11,Network:,Broadband Internet connection,Storage:,50 GB available space,Sound Card:,DirectX 11 or over","Recommended:,Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system,OS:,Windows 10 （64bit）,Processor:,Intel Core i7 8700 or over,Memory:,16 GB RAM,Graphics:,NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060,DirectX:,Version 11,Network:,Broadband Internet connection,Storage:,50 GB available space,Sound Card:,DirectX 11 or over",$59.99,

Thanks to the extraordinary quality of simulation, the game will allow you to experience the real atmosphere of the GT3 championship, competing against official drivers, teams, cars and circuits reproduced in-game with the highest level of accuracy ever achieved. Sprint, Endurance and Spa 24 Hours races will come to life with an incredible level of realism, in both single and multiplayer modes. Assetto Corsa Competizione will feature Blancpain GT Series’ 2018 Season, and will also include Season 2019, that will be provided as a free update during Summer 2019. Assetto Corsa Competizione is born from KUNOS Simulazioni's long-term experience, and it takes full advantage of Unreal Engine 4 to ensure photorealistic weather conditions and graphics, night races, motion capture animations, reaching a new standard in terms of driving realism and immersion, thanks to its further improved tyre and aerodynamic models. Designed to innovate, Assetto Corsa Competizione will be set to promote eSports, bringing players at the heart of the Blancpain GT Series and putting them behind the wheel of Ferraris, Lamborghinis, McLarens and many other prestigious GT racing cars, all reproduced with outstanding level of detail. REALISTIC SIMULATION Assetto Corsa Competizione is designed to faithfully recreate the performance and the driving experience of real Blancpain GT Series cars through a sophisticated mathematical model that accurately replicates tyre grip, aerodynamic impact, engine parameters, suspensions and electronics systems that determine vehicle balance, as well as the influence of mechanical damage on the car's drivability. NEW-GENERATION GRAPHICS AND VISUAL EFFECTS Unreal Engine 4 guarantees photorealistic rendering and an accurate representation of scenarios, car materials and weather conditions. Thanks to the multi-channel audio sampling of real GT cars, the game conveys captivating and immersive acoustic surroundings and realistic environmental effects. CARE FOR DETAILS Even the secondary details are faithfully reproduced to make you feel the thrill of being in the cockpit of a real racing car. Doors, windshield wipers, headlights, racing lights, racing equipment and control devices such as ABS, traction control, engine ignition and ECU mapping, are all under the driver’s management to assure the best performance and offer the player total control of the car. THE MOST ACCURATE CIRCUITS Thanks to Laserscan technology, every official circuit is recreated with the utmost accuracy: all curbs and details perfectly fit their real counterparts to grant a gaming experience as faithful to reality as possible. ADVANCED MULTIPLAYER FUNCTIONALITY A well-structured ranking system will evaluate individual performance and driving behaviour to reward the most virtuous drivers and promote fair play in online competitions.

The Special Events will allow you to gain a first-hand experience of the most noteworthy real-life Blancpain GT Series challenges. HIGH-LEVEL HARDWARE COMPATIBILITY Assetto Corsa Competizione ensures full compatibility with a wide range of peripherals from gamepads to professional steering wheels. MOTION CAPTURE FOR REALISTIC ANIMATIONS Motion capture technology is used to create the animations of mechanics and drivers in an even more realistic fashion, and guarantee a high level of player engagement during races, pit stops and driver changes. BLANCPAIN GT SERIES Encouraged by the success of the Blancpain Endurance Series, which after its creation in 2011 quickly became the global reference for GT racing, world-renowned Swiss watch manufacturer Blancpain and the SRO Motorsports Group decided at the end of 2013 to extend their partnership to the Blancpain Sprint Series. From 2015, teams and drivers were also given the opportunity to compete for an overall Blancpain GT Series title. Varied grids were the result, with a host of respected GT teams and drivers at the start of each race. The Blancpain GT Series also saw an influx of young and talented drivers, making it a worldwide benchmark in GT3 racing. With both the Blancpain GT Series Sprint Cup and Blancpain GT Series Endurance Cup now sharing the same driver categories and points system, the ten-round Blancpain GT Series season – comprising five sprint events and five endurance events – crowns the world’s most complete GT drivers. A Blancpain GT Series Sprint Cup event consists of two races of one hour each, while the Blancpain GT Series Endurance Cup races range from three-hour events through a 1000 km race to the season highlight of the Total 24 Hours of Spa, one of the world’s leading 24-hour races.",,"Minimum:,Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system,OS:,Windows 7 64-bit Service Pack 1,Processor:,Intel Core i5-4460 or AMD FX-8120,Memory:,4 GB RAM,Graphics:,GeForce GTX 460 2GB, Radeon HD 7770,DirectX:,Version 11,Storage:,50 GB available space,Sound Card:,Integrated","Recommended:,Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system,OS:,Windows 10 64-bit,Processor:,Intel Core i5-8600K or AMD Ryzen 5 2600X,Memory:,16 GB RAM,Graphics:,GeForce GTX 1070 8 GB, Radeon RX 580 8GB,DirectX:,Version 11,Storage:,50 GB available space,Sound Card:,Integrated",$44.99,

It is a game targeted at enthusiasts of the genre who are looking for a deeper experience. While a lot of effort has been put into the interface, and there is a short tutorial, there is still a significant learning curve (especially while in Early Access). Order your colonists to build the ultimate base in multiple Z levels. Manage your colonists' needs. Watch your colonists live their own lives and have their own relationships. Build aqueducts and pumps to manage a detailed water simulation system. Farm food with a detailed plant simulation system. Tame and hunt animals. Craft dozens of different items to keep your colonists happy and defend yourself. Dig deep to find sources of metal ore with a prospecting system. Explore the massive game map. Defend your colony with a detailed combat system. Play a procedurally generated map with different biomes and places of interest each time. Each component of an item has a material and quality which affects the item differently. Impress or fight with other factions. Trade with other factions. EXPLORE Explore a huge procedurally generated 3D world and meet its inhabitants. Embark simulates thousands of flora and fauna in detail. Time of day, seasons, temperature, and precipitation are modeled in detail. These conditions can have effects that help or hinder your colony. Crops can fail from lack of water or an early frost. CRAFT Gather a large variety of materials and craft items with a deep hierarchical crafting item system. With practice comes the ability to build better items, smith more effective weapons and armours, and smelt better ores. Each part of an item affects its effectiveness in different ways. A spear could be made with an iron head and wooden shaft, or it could have a steel head and bronze shaft. BUILD Rebuild civilization block by block. Embark’s fully destructible world allows you to build anything from small trading outposts to huge fortresses. Order your people to build complex structures and sit back and watch as they complete them. Your colony depends on you. Your management style may result in a cohesive well oiled military machine or a dysfunctional band on the brink of murdering each other. Reward a skilled craftsman with a larger room to make her more productive but be careful, as her friends may get jealous at the “unfair” treatment. DEFEND Defend yourself from multiple threats using a deep combat system which models individual body parts, weapon sizes, character skills, and more. Build the ultimate fort to keep intruders out, but beware! Some enemies can dig, climb, or fly to reach you.",,"Minimum:,Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system,OS:,Windows® 7, 64-bit,Processor:,Intel Core 2 Duo E4700 2.6 GHz or AMD Phenom 9950 Quad Core 2.6 GHz,Memory:,4 GB RAM,Graphics:,1GB ATI Radeon HD 5770, 1GB NVIDIA GeForce GTX 460 or better,DirectX:,Version 11,Storage:,2 GB available space,Additional Notes:,If you have issues with lower spec GPUs on world generation, change ""World Generation Quality"" in the options menu to Low.","Recommended:,Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system,OS:,Windows® 7, 64-bit,Processor:,Intel Core i5-2500K or AMD Ryzen 5 1400,Memory:,8 GB RAM,Graphics:,4GB NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970 or AMD Radeon RX 570,DirectX:,Version 11,Storage:,3 GB available space",$24.99,

Lobotomy Corp is a Monster Management Rogue-Lite Simulation game. Our game was inspired by the monsters from game and movies such as SCP series, Cabin in the woods and Warehouse 13. Furthermore, it was developed from the thought of “What if those monsters were real and your job is to manage them”. You will be playing as an administrator of the company which is in the management of such creatures. These monsters generate a new energy source, and your job is to collect them through giving out to your subordinates. Through this process, you can open new departments that facility allows and encounter various monsters. In the game, the player will have to go through the company’s fear and tension filled the atmosphere. “Our new technology will bring salvation to the human race.” Lobotomy corporation is a newly established energy company that extracts an infinite amount of entropy through the isolation of abnormality with our self-developed technology. This is only an impression that the public has regarding our company. You will see its reality after you have joined us. Our facility is formed of many departments just like any other companies. You will have access to various departments as you gather more energy. The more you have access to various departments, the much easier the management of abnormality will become. Furthermore, an AI ‘Angela’ and ‘Sephira’ will be by your side to support your needs for the smooth process of work. An existence you constantly have to examine and observe. We have decided to call the monsters in Lobotomy as ‘Abnormality’. You will have to try your best to keep your employees out of danger while keeping the energy extraction level at its maximum. At first, you won’t have any information on Abnormality. You will only have your eyes and the manual to guide you. Speculate which process will be most suitable for each Abnormality. After that, just pick and place your employee who is best suited for the job and wait for results. Also, you will have to gather information through giving out orders to your employees to ‘examine’ the creature. You get the power to obtain information in the process of managing Abnormality. Abnormality’s energy generation level depends on their conditions This game is NOT a tycoon. As mentioned before, Abnormality is a creature that should be handled with an extreme alert. Some of them might don’t like the idea of humans keeping them locked up in chambers. They will try to escape when they have a chance and when they do, they will destroy everything. Be it our employees or the facility. Furthermore, certain Abnormality can brainwash and corrupt our employees into their pawn. These ‘pawns’ can have a bad effect on other employees and might randomly attack the people around them. Also, they also bring down the other employees’ mentality level which might result in disobedience. You could get rid them of course, but you should consider the fact that all the information and data regarding that employee will be deleted as well. One disaster will cause another, and it will lead everything into chaos. If you do not stop them instantly, the situation will get out of hand and fall into chaos. When this situation does occur, you will have to decide whether you will gather employees to recapture the Abnormality, or destroy some part of the facility with explosives to secure the company’s safety.  “Do you have any wishes, administrator?” Lobotomy corporation is divided into work procedure and the story mode. In work procedure, you will be doing your job as the company’s administrator managing the Abnormality and the energy generation level. A game’s story will follow right afterward. In Story mode, there is a dialogue with Sephira, including AI Angela, which will also appear in the work part. Through the mission they give, you will come closer to the truth hidden in the company. Furthermore, the player will be placed in a situation where they must answer or ask questions. You can also discover secrets surrounding the company and the player.",,,,$24.99,

Defeat strange and alien creatures, engage in rich dialogue, and explore the dark and dangerous Planescape setting in this 50+ hour RPG classic. This is Planescape: Torment like you’ve never seen before. Story ""What can change the nature of a man?"" You are the Nameless One, a hulking figure covered in scars and tattoos collected over the course of countless lives—none of which you can remember, but are now coming back to haunt you. You are prodded awake by Morte, a floating skull and keeper of secrets, to embark on an adventure taking The Nameless One from the dirty streets of Sigil into the mysterious Outer Planes and even into the depths of Hell itself. Portals riddle the planar metropolis of Sigil, providing access to anywhere in existence, but only if you have the proper key. Known as the ""City of Doors,"" Sigil is a neutral ground where demons, devas, and races from across the multiverse gather under the watchful shadow of the Lady of Pain, the city's enigmatic ruler. This is a place where the word is mightier than the sword, where thought defines reality, and belief has the power to reshape worlds. In your search for answers, you'll find companions matching the bizarre nature of the planes: a chaste succubus who can kill with a kiss, a confused crossbow-wielding cube, a suit of armor animated by a spirit demanding JUSTICE, and more. With these companions and others at The Nameless One’s side, you will explore worlds in search of answers, all to discover that some destinies cannot be escaped and some memories cost more than an even an immortal can bear.

From small scouts over a wide range of ship classes up to the biggest carrier, everything can be piloted from the cockpit or an external view. A big focus in the development of X4 has been to achieve a seamless and immersive experience when moving between ships. You can leave a ship, climb down a ladder, walk over the dock of a large space station into another ship you may have parked there and replace the pilot that was working for you just by clicking on his chair. Modular stations and ship upgrades: Building space stations and factories has always been a foundation of the X games. After gaining enough money through fighting or trading, most players want to establish their own economy and start influencing the universe on a larger scale. In X4, it is now possible to be completely free and creative. Stations can be constructed from a variety of modules, be it production modules, living sections, docks or many other types of parts. The powerful new map system allows you to drag and connect modules using a connection system to design your own unique creations. Ships also offer a variety of upgrades. Engines, weapons and other equipment can be added in a graphical editor and actually seen on the ship. Most dynamic X universe ever: X4 will be the first X game to allow our races and factions to freely build and expand their empires; the same flexibility the player enjoys in creatively designing space stations from modular building blocks is also available to them. Races expand their empire based on supply and demand, which leads to an extremely dynamic universe where every action the player makes can influence the course of the entire universe. Managing your empire with a powerful map: Once you have more ships and many NPCs working for you as pilots, crew or station managers, the map will be your preferred method of managing it all. Ships can be ordered with simple clicks and through drag-and-drop operations to set their future path and commands. Graphically plan your trade routes, coordinate attacks with your entire fleet, manage the hierarchy or send ships on remote exploration missions. Most detailed X economy ever: One of the key selling points of X games has always been the realistic, simulated economy. Wares produced by hundreds of stations and transported by thousands of ships are actually traded by NPCs and prices develop based on this simulated economy. This is the foundation of our living and breathing universe. Now with X4, we have taken another, massive step. For the first time in any X game, all parts of the NPC economy are manufactured from resources. Ships, weapons, upgrades, ammo and even stations. You name it. Everything comes out of the simulated economy. Research and Teleportation: The seamless change from ship to ship and from NPCs controlling your empire for you continues on a higher level. Once you own a larger fleet, you will be very interested in researching a technology from your HQ: Teleportation. Once you've unlocked teleportation, you can jump from ship to ship a lot quicker and experience all the critical situations your NPCs encounter first hand. Every order you have given to a ship before turns into a mission objective when you pilot the ship yourself. The moment you leave again, your pilot takes the helm and continues with their previous orders. Get into the game: In X4, you can start your journey from a number of different gamestarts and as a number of different characters, each with their own role, set of relationships and different ships and technologies to start with. No matter how you start, you are always free to develop in any other direction. Focus on exploration, make money with illegal trading and theft, command large battle fleets or become the greatest entrepreneur ever.

Features Detailed construction system rewards well-designed architectural, atmospheric, and electrical plans. Atmospherics system includes: temperature, pressure, combustion, gas mixtures, water, and fire. Full physics on dynamic items in the world, including atmospheric effects such as wall fatigue, and explosive decompression. Various dangerous environments to explore and develop including exotic planets, and asteroid belts. Fully deformable voxel terrain on worlds and asteroids enhances mining and exploration. Build flyable motherships to assist your exploration and resource gathering efforts. Farm livestock and grow plants, not only for food, but also as a integral part of the station’s atmospherics. Construct complex factories in space using machines, conveyors, and computers. Use the medical system to cure ailments faced by other Stationeers. Designed from the ground up for multithreading to ensure great multiplayer performance and scalability. Stationeers is designed for hardcore players who want a game that is systems oriented. Full utilization and optimization of these complex systems will only come from great knowledge and practice. The game presents a variety of science-based survival problems that you must address.  Resource and time pressures will drive your initial designs, but the demands of a thriving station will guide you later. Space is empty and the planets are unforgiving to human life. You and your friends initially must decide how to meet your basic needs. Longer term, you will need to engineer solutions to power, heat, resource, and atmospheric problems. Build the most efficient systems you can by utilizing machines and programmable computers to develop automated systems. Whether on a distant lonely planet, or deep inside an asteroid field, you control every aspect of building & running your station or mothership.  Harvest nearby resources and use a wide range of tools to construct the ultimate station. Everything your station requires will be built and managed by you and your friends. What do you do with all that ore you mine? Process it through machines and turn it into goods for more construction of course! There are lots of specialist machines to build and configure such as smelters, sorters, centrifuges, stackers, conveyors, fabricators and more. Stations are generally safe locations, but motherships are flyable stations which allow you to leave that safety behind. These are excellent platforms for your exploration and resource gathering efforts.

Project: Gorgon also features an ambitious skill-based leveling system that bucks the current trend of pre-determined classes, allowing the player to combine skills in order to create a truly unique playing experience. AN IMMERSIVE WORLD When you play Project: Gorgon, we want you to feel as if you’re immersed in a whole new virtual world. Rather than trying to manage this with just graphics and excessive backstory, we’ve designed the game with dozens of gameplay features that make you feel like you’re really there interacting with the world, such as: Each non-player (NPC) you meet has their own goals and interest, and reward players that choose to be their friend. You can drop items on the ground, and other players can pick them up. What’s so great about that? Imagine laying down a trail of literal (virtual) breadcrumbs to guide your friends (or lure your enemies) into the woods. Shopkeepers keep inventory, so you can buy items that other players have sold to them. Want to help out new players? Sell your cast-off items to the shopkeeper in the new player zone and watch the new players go to town. If you are on fire, you can jump into a lake to put it out. This type of mechanic can have a subtle effect on your strategies, especially when you are fighting a fire mage! You can inscribe messages onto items, write books, and even leave notes for other players. Make your name as an in-game poet, or pronounce your greatness to the world! UNIQUE EXPERIENCES In Project: Gorgon you kill monsters - a lot of them - and you take their loot. In order to keep the experience fun and interesting, we’ve developed unique combat experiences to keep the fights feeling fresh. The loot is randomly generated, monsters have unique abilities, and dungeons have puzzles, traps, and terrifying bosses! The combat skills are entirely free-form. You can learn as many combat skills as you want, and use any two of them at the same time to create your own personal “class.” Project: Gorgon features dozens to choose from, including: Battle Chemistry: Create huge explosions, inject yourself with mysterious mutagens or program a pet golem! Unarmed Combat: Grapple and control enemies using a situational-aware combo system that varies based on where you are and what day it is. Animal Handling: Tame animals and train them to become ferocious fighters. Then breed your best and sell their offspring to other players. Necromancy: Seek out corpses and graveyards to raise an undead army. No graveyard around? Well, there are always the corpses of your friends. Cow: Got turned into a cow by that boss? That sucks. But learn some kicks and how to stampede, and you'll be right back out there kicking grass in no time! That’s just a few! There’s also Sword Fighting, Combat Psychology, Staff Fighting, Sigil Scripting, Mentalism, and more. Player Choices are important in Project: Gorgon. You can learn as many skills as you want, but sometimes power comes with downsides. You can become infected with lycanthropy and gain access to very powerful skill sets. As a lycanthrope, you are able to roam the world in a pack or as a lone wolf; however, when there is a full moon (which is tied to the real world lunar calendar) you are stuck in your beast form. There’s no cure for lycanthropy. You can become a Druid - which will give you great power, but you have to vow to drop everything when there’s an emergency involving nature. It could be a forest fire, a monster invasion or even a pesky insect. Nature never lets you ignore your duties, ever. New opportunists come open, but others will be closed. Can you bear heavy burdens in exchange for greater power? JOIN THE COMMUNITY The community is a critical aspect of Project: Gorgon. We strive to maintain a strong, engaged community, supporting our players through: Live Events with a focus on story. Mechanisms For player-created quest content. Player housing (limited and instanced). Player-managed shops and vendor stalls. In-game communication tools like bulletin boards. Bookshelves where you can write and submit your own books and stories (and players can vote on their favorites). HELP DEFINE THE GAME During our beta (""early access"") period, your feedback helps improve the game, from small things like bug-reports to large things like new skill suggestions, monster ideas, and more! We've already used hundreds of player-provided suggestions during our alpha period, and we'll use even more suggestions during beta as we get into the down-and-dirty details of combat, crafting, and exploration."," Mature Content Description  The developers describe the content like this:  This game contains fantasy violence as well as references to fantasy drugs and alcohol.

The officially licensed multiplayer version of the classic fantasy adventure board game, Talisman. In Talisman Digital Edition, there are 14 characters a player can control, from the heroic Warrior to the powerful Sorceress. In this perilous adventure, players battle it out to journey across a dangerous land and be the first to claim the Crown of Command, a magical artefact with the power to destroy all rivals and make the bearer the true ruler of the kingdom. On your travels, you will need strength, courage and some good dice rolls to survive the dangers you face and beat your opponents to the centre of the board. Features - Multiplayer modes for up to 6 players. Play against AI opponents. 14 characters to choose from. 17 powerful spells to cast. Many expansions available. Detailed, interactive tutorial. Based on the Revised 4th Edition by Fantasy Flight Games. Frequently Asked Questions What is Talisman? Talisman is a board game in which you move around the board building up your character’s strength and magic power by battling monsters, finding treasures, completing quests and trying to be the first player to reach the centre space – the Crown of Command. Can I play dirty? That’s at the very core of Talisman! Cast spells at other players to make them miss turns! Steal from them! Turn them into toads! Send powerful allies to do your fighting for you! How replayable is the game? The emergent nature of the game means that every game will tell its own tale. The board starts with just the playing pieces and builds up to become a land filled with terrible danger and fabulous treasure! As you move around the board, you must make careful decisions about where to travel as each space can become more dangerous or more helpful as the game progresses. To help you get around, players can use things like teleporting, magic portals and fate, which allows you to re-roll your dice to get different results. How long is a game of Talisman? The physical board game can take 2-5 hours with 6 players, but our digital version cuts that down drastically, with an offline 6 player game typically taking no more than 1 hour. Offline and online games can be saved and resumed at any time so your adventures can take as long as you like! We’ve also added some features which decrease the length of games – House rules and Runestone cards. House rules change the basic rules slightly to speed-up the game and Runestone cards, exclusive to this digital edition, give characters extra abilities and allow them to become very powerful much quicker, making for shorter games. Is there a hotseat mode? Yes! Look your opponents in the eyes as you face them in deadly combat or sneak up from the shadows and steal their favourite items! All of the fun and social enjoyment of the physical game is captured in the digital version, but with no setup time! What’s included with the base game and are there expansions? For the initial purchase, everything that you get with the physical board game is included – all of the characters, spells and adventure cards, plus a few bonuses we've added. Many expansions are available now. These add lots more spells, events, monsters, characters and alternative endings! Extra characters are also available to purchase, including rare characters from Talisman’s history. Talisman © Games Workshop Limited 1983, 1985, 1994, 2007.

On the fringes of known space, something is silently abducting entire human colonies. Now Shepard must work with Cerberus, a ruthless organization devoted to human survival at any cost, to stop the most terrifying threat mankind has ever faced. To even attempt this perilous mission, Shepard must assemble the galaxy’s most elite team and command the most powerful ship ever built. Even then, they say it would be suicide. Commander Shepard intends to prove them wrong. Just like in the previous game, what you say to the other characters matters a great deal. Fortunately, the conversation system has been improved. The camera now pans around characters as they talk to one another to evoke a dramatic, cinematic feel. Also, Shepard can interrupt the conversation when given the appropriate prompt, taking situations into new directions that could help or hinder the mission. Shepard is more customizable than ever, letting you create your ideal lead character — gender, facial features, class, and of course, attitude. Once you embark on missions, you’ll be treated to an improved battle system that lets you target weak points and blast off your enemy’s limbs with a variety of weapons. Set out to lead your team to victory… or die at the hands of The Collectors. Either path is possible in BioWare’s smash hit, Mass Effect 2. Which destiny will you choose?

Blast them to smithereens with good old fashioned guns. Demolish them with explosive arrows. Take them down with kunais and shurikens or slaughter them with a glaive. It's entirely up to you.  • Keep upgrading your abilities and weapons as you accumulate experience from completing missions. Become the true ninja warrior hero you've always wanted to be.  • Traverse a reimagined futuristic Japan in unique oriental locations.

Turn back the Russian tide in the Ukraine. Ride the Mediterranean waves in fast Israeli attack craft, trading barrages of anti-ship missiles with Syrian ships. Stand toe-to-toe against Iran in the Persian Gulf. Wrestle the Falklands under your control. Go “Down Town” around Hanoi and spar with the deadly NV air defences. Hunt down rogue nukes in Pakistan before they fall into terrorist hands. Face off with your carrier group against India or China – from either side. Square off against the Soviet Union in the cold war confrontation, and against resurgent Russia in the new multipolar world order. Lead nuclear-powered sharks of steel against the masters of antisubmarine ops. Exchange volleys of fire in close-quarters gun duels, or obliterate the enemy with sophisticated, heavy-hitting hypersonic missiles from hundreds or thousands of miles away. Survive massive, vicious air battles. Escort vital convoys to their destination, or make a last stand against all odds. When things escalate out of control, step up to unconventional or even nuclear weapons. Play the most dangerous game of hide and seek – at sea, on land and in the air - even in near-space. Command is the next generation of air/naval wargaming. YOU ARE IN CONTROL Surface fleets, submarine squadrons, air wings, land-based batteries and even satellite constellations are yours to direct as you see fit – from the lowliest pirate skiff to the mightiest aircraft carrier, from propeller biplanes to supersonic stealth fighters, and from WW2-era iron bombs, torpedoes & mines and the trusty ""Mk1 Eyeball"" to ultra-modern radars with imaging capability, multi-spectral recon satellites, ""brilliant"" self-guided stand-off weapons, 200-knot supercavitating torpedoes and hypersonic anti-ship ballistic missiles. Every sensor and weapon system is modeled in meticulous detail. You are given the hardware; but you have to use it well. THE WORLD AT YOUR FINGERTIPS Throw your distorted flat maps away – Command uses a realistic 3D earth globe for each of its scenarios. Rotate and zoom in and out of the action, from satellite view down to the trenches and wavetops. Play scenarios or build your own on any place on earth – from classics like the Middle East, South Atlantic, North Cape and Europe to new and rising hotspots like the Arctic, the Pacific and the Indian Ocean. Use a powerful yet intuitive point-and-click mouse interface for controlling your forces and go advanced with a wide collection of hotkeys for quickly jumping around the action and issuing complex orders in the heat of the battle. RELENTLESS REALISM Sensors and weapons work just like in real life, with all their strengths and weaknesses. Units move, detect, fight and win or die based on what their systems can and cannot do. Electronic warfare and technological levels can tilt the balance of battle. The weather can be your best ally and your worst enemy. The terrain, both overland and undersea, can hide you from the enemy but also can block your weapons from firing. Your aircraft can choose different mission profiles and loadouts, each with its advantages and limitations, and can dash high (speed, range) or scream low (protection). Thermal layers, convergence zones, surface ducting, the deep sound channel and factors such as water temperature and terrain slope may decide the sub vs ship duel. Thick clouds or rain can render your fancy laser-guided bombs useless. Stealth may help you avoid detection, or a jamming barrage may tip the scales when you are out of options. Command’s battle environment is as unforgiving as the real thing – and as rewarding for those who understand and use it. THE MEN AT THE CONTROLS Your war machines are (almost always) not robots; they are crewed by humans. People trained with varied proficiency (from novice to ace), operating under custom doctrine and rules of engagement (when to do what, how to decide, how to react etc.), most of the time making the rational decision, and sometimes making a brilliant call or a mistake. These people often matter far more than the hardware. The very same surface-to-air missile battery that is a worthless toy when staffed by Iraqi or Libyan crews turns to a deadly weapon even against ultra-modern aircraft under the expert hand of Egyptian, Serbian or Russian operators. The deadliest combat units are only as sharp as their crews. AIR/NAVAL WARFARE AROUND THE WORLD Korea. Colonial wars. Vietnam. Middle East. Cuba. Falklands. Iran-Iraq. World War 3. Desert Storm. India & Pakistan. The Arctic circle. Past and future conflicts in the Pacific, Norwegian Sea, Russian periphery and more. Experience conflict from post-WW2 all the way to 2020+ and beyond. Test your mettle against lethal land-based missile batteries, air regiments, naval fleets or pirate groups. Face off against threats of the past, present and future. How do you measure up against the challenges of modern warfare? LEAD, DON’T MICROMANAGE Realistic modern combat with all its technicalities scaring you away? Your staff & tactical AI sweat the details so you don’t have to. Airbase crews shuffle aircraft around on land facilities to prepare them for the next mission. Aircraft position themselves to deliver their payloads optimally, and refuel on their own if they have to; Ships and subs maneuver on their own to reach out and touch the enemy (including winding their way around islands, landmasses and even known mines) – and everyone tries very hard to save his skin when bullets are flying. Manage the big decisions and let your virtual crews get to the details – and still intervene whenever you want. MAKE YOUR OWN WAR Think you can build a better conflict? Prove it! Command’s integrated scenario editor offers unparalleled functionality for making your own scenarios or editing existing ones. Create and share with other players detailed, exact-down-to-the-meter land installations from all over the world – from airbases to port complexes to ICBM fields. Customize unit icons, sound effects, even platform weapons and sensors (Aegis on the USS Iowa – click and done). Create multiple sides with variable, complex alliances and postures and different proficiency ratings. Assign forces to detailed missions with custom behaviors and inheritable doctrines. Script complex interactive events with the advanced event editor. Assign variable success thresholds – from triumph to utter defeat. From a gunboat duel all the way to global thermonuclear warfare – the possibilities are endless. HUNDREDS OF SCENARIOS Command MANO includes 42 scenarios (3 tutorials) and hundreds of community scenarios available FEATURES Powerful, detailed 3D-globe (Google Earth-style) with multiple map layers Intuitive, point-and-click user interface for beginners backed up by a vast array of hotkeys for power users Aircraft, surface ships, submarines, land units, strategic & space forces and all their real-life sensors, weapons and other systems are at your disposal Extensive, detailed simulation databases modeling faithfully the capabilities & limitations of each unit More then 40 included scenarios covering multiple historic and hypothetical conflicts.

In Shine City, the anti-gravity ball game has long been illegal. The group who kept playing was dubbed the Lethal League. Even now, with their sport pushed underground, players and crews compete in the League for challenge and respect. In the game, the goal is to beat your opponents with the ball. You can manipulate the ball to get the perfect angle and use your character's special moves to surprise them. But every strike speeds up the ball or even doubles its speed, up to shatteringly extreme velocities. You can tag the ball to your color, but on those high speeds the tables are quickly turned. You can play locally with friends and foes, by yourself in the singleplayer modes or battle it out online! Featuring Up to 4 players:  Play locally AND online with up to 4 players. Easy to pick up, hard to master gameplay:  Start off simply hitting the ball faster and faster back and forth. Improve by learning how to use Smashes, Bunts and Special Abilities to your advantage. Then go further beyond with parries and countering with throws ending with the pure psychological goodness: taunts. Tons of unlockable extras and secrets:  Unlock characters and their outfits as you play. New modes and stages are in there too and even the soundtrack can be unlocked to play at leisure. Play on your own:  Step up to the plate by yourself and beat a series of opponents in the Arcade Mode to reach the beat-blasting bossfight. Then check out the event-based Story Mode that has you playing all sides of the going-downs in Shine City. Modes and options: Pick your preferred style of play like with HP, one-shot kill or points. And then there are game modes like Strikers, using goals, and something called Lethal Volley... Wicked Tracks:  A Breakbeat, Hip-Hop and House soundtrack featuring the likes of Hideki Naganuma, Frank Klepacki, Pixelord, Bignic and of course Klaus Veen.

Engage in desperate car chases, diagnose life-threatening injuries, and put out lethal fires! Each department has its own vehicles and equipment for you to operate while on duty. Play in single player, or work together with friends in online multiplayer to tackle incidents across a shared world. Usually the first to respond to a criminal incident, the police are equipped with the fastest vehicle and a variety of equipment. Their roles vary from handing out parking tickets to chasing down dangerous suspects. They’ll do everything they can to prevent criminal activity and put a stop to any crimes in progress. As an emergency medical specialist, your job lies in keeping members of the public alive, treating patients’ injuries, diagnosis and more. Lifesaving equipment you’ll utilise includes medical kits, stretchers and ambulances. The role of the fire department extends far beyond putting out flames, as they work closely with medical services out in the field, swiftly cutting open crashed cars so that medical staff can reach the casualty. The fire department won’t engage in the pursuit of suspects, but will handle the aftermath of an incident, including, of course, putting out fires. Battling raging flames and freeing trapped civilians involves some heavy-duty gear including spreaders, a fire hose, a fire extinguisher and a fire truck. MULTI-PLAYER Team up with fellow players online and divide your team between the three emergency services at will. Race around the open world in various vehicles, to where you are needed, working together to help civilians in accidents or catch a fleeing criminal. MISSIONS Various calls to action will see you responding to incidents based on your chosen department, as well as the relevant area in the open world. From speeding and illegal parking, to raging fires and life-threatening car accidents, the pressure is on in Flashing Lights. THE WORLD Flashing Lights features a thriving open world (currently 3.5KM x 3.5KM) that will see emergencies break out in all corners of life. Early Access All screenshots on this page are a work in progress, and visuals are subject to change. It is our plan to expand the open world to include different environments, missions and scenarios. We will also be adding further emergency services equipment and gameplay mechanics throughout the Early Access period.",,,,$14.99,

Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy is a punishing climbing game, a homage to Jazzuo's 2002 B-Game classic 'Sexy Hiking'. You move the hammer with the mouse, and that's all there is. With practice, you'll be able to jump, swing, climb and fly. Great mysteries and a wonderful reward await the master hikers who reach the top of the mountain. To quote Jazzuo himself: ""The hiking action is very similar to way you would do it in real life, remember that and you will do well"". Climb up an enormous mountain with nothing but a hammer and a pot. Listen as I make philosophical observations about the problem at hand. Between 2 and ∞ hours of agonizing gameplay, depending.

Evoking memories of the most revered shooters of the past two decades, Splitgate: Arena Warfare embraces the classic and familiar feel of close-quarters combat while adding a multi-directional twist that adds a never-before-seen spatial wrinkle to the arena shooter setting. Battle against up to 10 friends in online multiplayer or refine your skills versus formidable AI. Splitgate: Arena Warfare is designed to be equally accessible to first-time and veteran FPS players, with an infinitely high skill cap that will take players hundreds of hours to refine and master. Splitgate is built in Unreal Engine 4 by 1047 Games, a passionate group of Halo fans, whose experience and love for the genre transcends the typical development team. Fly. Flank. Frag. Constant movement is encouraged and rewarded as players strategically place portals to FLY, FLANK and FRAG through the air to create incredible, previously-impossible highlights. 1-50 Ranking System  Instead of a complicated and convoluted matchmaking system, Splitgate: Arena Warfare uses a simple, intuitive 1-50 ranking system determined purely on player wins and losses, cutting down on in-game griefing while providing little incentive for player boosting. Equal Playing Field Players start each match with the same loadout, eliminating any unfair advantages from the start. Power weapons spawn on a timer across the map, and players are encouraged to use these powerful weapons to achieve montage-worthy killstreaks. Easy to Learn, Difficult to Master Standard FPS controls and intuitive portal mechanics mean beginners are up and running right off the bat. However, players must constantly evolve strategies and their ability to think with portals in order to outsmart one another. The skill cap is unlimited.

The basic system and interface part (cover, overwatch, rush) of a battle to operate a combat system is similar to 'XCOM'. However, core battle rules for combat and the growth of characters that affect combat is similar to 'Final Fantasy Tactics'. Troubleshooter is a RPG game with strategic elements, not strategic games. So we like a more forgiving regarding death. Troubleshooter is a turn-based RPG with the story of Albus and the events happening around him. The story begins with Albus becoming an official Troubleshooter who then returns to his hometown to begin his journey as he meets new friends and colleagues on the way. The story of Albus will be updated continuously. You will experience different events and meet different people and make it through the missions by playing as Albus and controlling his colleagues. The characters appearing in the missions will have different decisions to make, and this will affect the relationships of the characters within the game to provide a slightly different story depending on the decisions. The current version contains tutorial, 33 scenario stages and 18 repeatable stages. There are colleagues who accompanies Albus through the game. You will be able to meet different characters as you play his story. You might meet them during missions and become friends or you can recruit them to make them an official member of the company.

Create your own industrial complexes with loading and unloading stations, storage, warehouses, and factories. Build the infrastructure and manage its traffic , including roads, railways, sidewalks, conveyors, wiring, and pipelines. Wisely place and connect factories, houses and warehouses, and make the most efficient connections. Plan and build the living areas with everything your citizens may need to live their happy life, such as playgrounds, cinema s, taverns, and shops. Send your citizens to the mine to get coal, iron and other natural resources; or send them to the fields to pick up the crops; or take them to factories to produce manufactured goods. Sell and purchase resources and goods from western countries or other soviet countries to get dollars or rubles and buy the products or resources you need ... or invest in new infrastructure or buildings. Enjoy authentic soviet buildings and vehicles , as well as realistic landscapes of the 60's to the 90's. Play the way you want! You can focus on getting natural resources or products and trade them for money; or you can build a self-sufficient republic; or you can just use the easy sandbox mode with unlimited money/resources and just enjoy building something live. Economic simulation. Prices of resources on the global market are changing over time as you play –one day you can sell or purchase steel for a $100 per ton, but in a few months the cost can rise to $200 or decrease to $50. The price of everything is connected to the cost of work and resources. Increasing difficulty. As prices change, the demands of the citizens also change, and you will need more resources to keep them happy and force them to work. RESOURCES & INDUSTRY There are, right now, over 30 commodities you can mine, transport and manufacture. If you want to get clothes you will first need to get resources to create a fabric, then you will need a clothing factory where the clothes will be manufactured from this fabric. You can then transport the finished clothes into shops where your citizens can buy them. Every commodity has a specific requirement,so if you would like to load oil into the tank train-car you will need a special pumping loading station. If you need to load gravel into a dumper truck you need a special loading station where the gravel comes from conveyors into the truck. Liquid resources like oil or fuel can be stored only in tanks, while resources like wood, steel, or prefabricated concrete panels can be stored outside in the open space. Using a crane for these will increase loading/unloading speed. Goods like clothes, food, etc. can be stored in warehouses. WORKERS AND THEIRS DEMANDS Every worker/citizen goes to work each day. If they work for you, they have demands. At the start of the game they are satisfied just with food, but as a time goes on they may have more demands like meat, clothes, alcohol or electronics. Also, to have happy workers you need places where they can spend their leisure time – cinema, playgrounds, taverns, etc. Every worker has an education level. They can go to school or college to improve this level. If their education is too low they cannot work; if their education is high enough they can be a teacher, or researcher, or work in factories with special requirements. TRANSPORTATION You have many options for how you will manage resources and goods transportation. If you get raw iron ore from a mine, you need to process it. Then you need to transport it somehow into a steel mill to produce steel. You can build the processing plant and steel mill near to the mine and transport it all by conveyors, or you can transport iron ore into a steel mill by train fora longer distance. It is up to you to decide from where the workers will go into the factories. You can create residential zones and transport workers by buses or trains to industrial areas. You can also build residential buildings near the factories so that workers will able to walk to the factory. But don't forget that a worker will need to purchase food and enjoy their free time, so again it is up to you to decide whether to build those facilities near their home or whether you will transport them somehow to shops or places to spend their free time. ECONOMY SIMULATION  The game simulates the economy system. There are no fixed prices! Costs of everything are defined by the economic situation. For example, the cost of steel is calculated from the price of iron, coal and work, and also partially from the cost of steel mill construction. You purchase or sell commodities for money (dollars or rubles). But be careful, as it is possible that if you buy or sell for high values you will affect the price of the commodity on the market. You may be able to purchase for a higher price or sell it cheaper. As time increases, so does complexity. Some resources or products may become more expensive (as, for example, less human work is needed with advanced technologies), so later with more complexity, it may be necessary to be as self-sufficient as possible.",,,,$24.99,

The massive and seemingly benevolent Eden Corporation owns the world. The elite hacker resistance movement SyndiK8 has unearthed the sinister reality behind Eden Corp’s newest line of robotic products. As one of SyndiK8’s elite operatives, your mission is straightforward: infiltrate Eden Tower, steal as much Raw Data as possible, and get out alive--bringing Eden Corp down in your wake. However, as the secrets behind Chairman Shiro’s new “Promotion” program becomes clear, the reality gets much more complicated. Does it really grant immortality? What is Eden truly collecting? It seems that Eden’s corporate veneer may be just a thin facade for something much, much worse. Built from the ground up for virtual reality, Raw Data ’s action combat gameplay, intuitive controls, challenging enemies, and sci-fi atmosphere will completely immerse you within the surreal environments of Eden Corp. Go solo—or team up with a friend—and become the adrenaline-charged heroes of your own futuristic technothriller. You will put your wits, boldness, and endurance to the test.

History is as yet unwritten From the early Italian campaign to the battle of Waterloo, Total War: NAPOLEON covers two decades of relentless battles, a backdrop of a world in flames against which the story of an extraordinary military career unfolds. Whether you play as the legendary general or against him, the outcome of war can never be guaranteed. The course of history relies on your ability to lead your troops through the most intense battles as never seen before in a Total War game. About The Peninsular Campaign The Peninsular Campaign is an independent campaign based on the conflict in the Spanish Peninsula between 1811 and 1814. It was during this era that the Spanish resistance gave their style of fighting its name: Guerrilla, or the “little war”. Play the campaign from three different perspectives, each with a unique feel: •	The French fight to keep resistance at bay while converting regions to their political alignment. •	The British are very limited for regions at the start but receive enough income from Northern Europe and North America that they can afford to liberate regions back to the Spanish in return for Guerrilla aid. •	The Spanish also have a limited starting position but have permanent access to Guerrillas for effective battlefield use against the French. Choose one of the three nations involved - France, Great Britain or Spain - and experience one of the most intense conflicts of the Napoleonic era. Key Features: •	A new and independent Iberian Peninsula campaign map featuring 32 controllable regions. •	5 new Guerrilla unit types, recruitable by all nations, adept at battlefield stealth and with the added ability to deploy outside of their faction's deployment zones: Tiradores (Skirmisher Infantry), Cazadores, Lanceros (Lancer Cavalry), Husares (Light Cavalry), Leader (General). •	28 new units in total, spread across the three playable nations including the British 95th Rifles, the French Vistula Uhlans and the Spanish Coraceros Espanoles. •	Two new agents to enforce political conversion: •	Provocateurs (French and British nations only) have the ability to promote anti-opposition sentiment in regions, incite unrest, decreases turn time for research and passively spy. •	Priests (Spanish and Portuguese nations only) have the ability to promote anti-opposition sentiment in regions and incite unrest. •	A new Guerrillero agent for the Spanish nation: similar to a Spy but with the new ability to Harass enemy armies - lock them in place for a turn and cause them attrition. •	Political Alignment system which sees the French battle to increase pro-French sentiment throughout the peninsula. About Coalition Battle Pack The Coalition Battle Pack features 6 brand new units and contains the Battle of Friedland fought between France and Russia. The Battle of Friedland (14 June, 1807) with Napoleon's empire at its height, he took a chance and defeated Russia in detail, knocking them out of the war and bringing the Fourth Coalition to an end. Unit Descriptions: •	Lifeguard Hussars: This fast light cavalry unit is best used for dealing with skirmishers and artillery who can attack from long range. •	Coldstream Guards: Disciplined, well-trained and respected, these elite foot guards inspire nearby troops in battle. •	Archduke Charles' Legion: This highly-disciplined line infantry regiment excels at weapons drill and accuracy. •	Luetzow's Freikorps: Swift light cavalry, the riders of Luetzow’s Freikorps are excellent in melee and on the charge. •	Life Hussars: Sabre-armed light cavalry, the Life Hussars are powerful on the charge and effective in melee combat. •	Semenovski Lifeguard: Immaculately turned out, these elite guards have excellent morale and are superb when used against skirmish troops and artillery.

MAIN FEATURES Full campaign: Fight in the American Civil War campaign and participate in 50+ battles from small engagements to massive battles that can last several days over hundreds of square miles of terrain. Campaign fully depends on player actions and battle results. Historical battles can also be played separately. The game includes the following battles in the campaign: Battle of Aquia Creek Battle of Philippi 1st Battle of Bull Run Battle of Shiloh Battle of Gaines' Mill Battle of Malvern Hill 2nd Battle of Bull Run Battle of Antietam Battle of Fredericksburg Battle of Stones River Battle of Chancellorsville Battle of Gettysburg Battle of Chickamauga Battle of Cold Harbor Battle of Richmond Battle of Washington + 48 smaller scale battles Army management: You are the general. You have full control over the army composition. Based on your successes and reputation you might get access to more corps, divisions and brigades. Keep your soldiers alive and they will learn to fight better, turning from green rookies to crack veterans. Lose a lot of your soldiers and you might not have enough reinforcements to deliver victories. Your reputation will suffer, army morale will drop and you will be forced to resign. Innovative command system: You decide which level of control you want. Command every unit individually or just give them a main goal with one button click and watch if they can take that hill. Army divisions commanders can make decisions on their own and help you control the largest army. Draw a defensive line and allocated brigades will defend it like lions. Or design a deep flanking maneuver by just drawing an arrow and send the whole army to the enemy flank or the rear. Your generals will try to fulfill your orders, although ""no plan survives contact with the enemy"". Officer progression: Historical unit commanders progress and become better fighters together with the player. The Officers rank up based on their units’ performance, but it's war and they can be wounded or even get killed in action. New ranks open new possibilities and allow officers to lead bigger units without efficiency loss. Winning battles also opens new possibilities for you as a general, increasing skills such as reconnaissance or political influence. Historical weapons: There is huge variety of Civil War weaponry from mass produced Enfield pattern rifles to rare Whitworths. Historical availability has also been implemented. Certain weapons can only be captured by raiding supplies or taken from the enemy on the battlefield. Enhanced unit control: Detach skirmishers to send them to scout those hills ahead. Or merge several brigades into one bigger division if it’s needed. Dismount the cavalry to become less visible to the enemy or mount for fast flanking charges and supply raids. Supplies are extremely important and you have to plan and defend the provisions otherwise the battle might end for you early. Advanced Artificial Intelligence: You will face a strong enemy. AI will flank you, will hit your weak spots and undefended high ground, will chase and cut your supplies and will try to destroy unguarded artillery batteries. AI will use terrain and will take cover and retreat if overwhelmed. Terrain matters: Trenches, lines, fences, houses, fields – everything can help to achieve victory, if you know how to use it. Hills will allow you to see enemy units earlier. Rivers and bridges can become natural obstacles that will help you to defend. Forests can help you hide your movements and flank the enemy. Beautiful maps: We believe that modern technology allows hardcore war-games to finally stop being brown on green hexes. Hardcore, deep war games can be beautiful. In our game, every historical battle landscape is accurately hand-drawn, utilizing data from satellite and historical maps. The topography plays immense strategic role and helps to understand how battles were fought and to learn history.",,"Minimum:,OS:,Windows 7 - 32 bit,Processor:,Intel i3,Memory:,2 GB RAM,Graphics:,512Mb VRAM, Minimum 1366x768 resolution, Intel HD 4000 and higher, GeForce 8800 and higher, AMD Radeon X1600,DirectX:,Version 9.0,Storage:,2 GB available space","Recommended:,OS:,Windows 10 - 64 bits,Processor:,Intel i5,Memory:,2 GB RAM,Graphics:,1GB VRAM, 1920x1080 resolution, Nvidia 960 or  Radeon R9 285,DirectX:,Version 9.0,Storage:,2 GB available space",$29.99,

Create a custom character and choose from several different classes to delve deep into the mysteries of what evil lurks below. Dig down and explore the randomly generated levels, find random items, and combat deadly monsters to get the answers. Though this game looks similar to other games in the genre, it plays very differently. It is a true RPG, with many stats and character classes. It is very reminiscent of other games made by David Brevik such as Diablo, Diablo II, Hellgate: London and Marvel Heroes. With eight character classes to choose from, randomly generated levels, random stats on items, secret areas, bosses, a survival talent tree and three different play modes, it delivers a very different and unique gaming experience. Are you ready to find out what Lurks Below? CREATE YOUR CHARACTER Bard (melee) - Wield the power of song and screaming to best your foes in battle. With trusty sword and shield and specializing in passive area effect damage and buffs, the bard is a force of nature in the battle field. ⠀⠀ Cleric (melee + ranged) - Come prepared for battle with heavy armor and plenty of healing power. Choose to fight with a mace and shield or a ranged wand. The cleric is the only class who is given this choice. Paired with its high survive-ability, it is the class that will outlive all others. ⠀⠀ Enchanter (ranged) - Stun and lightning are the enchanters tools of choice. What better way to avoid damage than stopping enemies in their tracks. If that wasn't enough, the enchanter can wield the power of illusion and turn into a wisp and fly away. ⠀⠀ Necromancer (ranged) - Wielding the skulls of the dead as undead minions, marks the necromancer as the games resident pet class. Pair this with powerful poison and cold damage and self buffs, means the necromancer is an undead friendly powerhouse. ⠀⠀ Paladin (melee) - Dashing into combat wielding a powerful two handed sword or hammer makes the paladin one of the most formidable melee characters in the game. Consecrating the ground, area effect purification and damage are just a few of the tools this powerful holy warrior brings to the table. ⠀⠀ Rogue (melee) - Slip past enemies by hiding in the shadows and then when the moment is right, stab them with the rogue's powerful dual wielding daggers. ⠀⠀ Warrior (melee) - Decide between defensive stance and offensive stance; both make the warrior an incredible beast in battle. While defensive stance focuses on survive-ability and offensive stance focuses on damage, both are incredibly satisfying, especially combined with the warriors whirlwind ability. ⠀⠀ Wizard (ranged) - Harnessing the power of the elements through powerful area affect spells make the wizard an unstoppable elemental force. Their spell set is rounded out with a drake companion and teleport. ⠀⠀⠀ CHOOSE YOUR GAME STYLE ⠀⠀ Creative - Enjoy all the game has to offer in more relaxed setting. No need to worry about survival mechanics, though still have the benefit of the survival tree. Many of the recipes and building supplies are already unlocked, which makes it much easier to languish in the joy of building and farming the whole surface. With no invasions to worry about, the only monsters that will be encountered are below in the dungeon. Descent - Same difficulty as Survival, just without the survival aspect. For anyone interested in just thrashing monsters and getting all the loot. No survival tree, no hunger, and no fatigue. Survival - This is the original game design mode. Not that this makes the other modes any less valid, but most of the game is designed with Survival Mode in mind. This includes all the bells and whistles of surviving and the survival tree, paired with difficult dungeon challenges and plenty of invasions. Hardcore - Both Survival and Descent have a hardcore option. This doesn't change anything about the particular mode other than you get only one death. Choose what works best for you! There are no wrong choices! FEW LAST TIPS! Surviving is rough out here (unless you are playing Descent, in which case, learn to make potions!). Make sure to grab all the food you can find, cook your vegetable, chop down trees, dig up ore, craft some new armor, and start your farm. ⠀⠀ One last thing that will help with survival, inventory space and your characters fabulous look is to build up your town.

Exanima's exceptional attention to detail and realistic simulation of all things aim to provide a deeply immersive and dynamic gameplay experience. Features include a deep skill based combat system, complex and smart AI, fully interactive environments, an advanced damage model with accurate collisions and locational protection, roguelike elements and an arena mode to hone your combat skills. ""Those who would enter the underworld shall not only forfeit their lives... ...but bring oblivion to all mankind."" WARNING: THIS GAME IS ACTUALLY DIFFERENT! This game features a very deep, truly physics based combat system. This is not just some animation feature, it is a fundamental difference that is central to gameplay. Real momentum, forces and collisions are always at play here, every nuance of your inputs is crucial to the outcome. This will likely be unlike anything you've played before and may take some practice, but can be hugely rewarding and the skill cap is virtually infinite. It is not particularly fast paced or difficult but it does require you to pay attention, it is very tactical and just casually pressing buttons won't get you very far! Our goal is to create a deep and immersive RPG world based on a more advanced simulation supporting an unprecedented level of dynamic and emergent gameplay. All of the technology we use including the game engine is our own, developed from the ground up to realise this vision. Exanima is born as a prelude to Sui Generis (SG), our ambitious open world RPG that has been in development for over two years following a successful Kickstarter campaign. Exanima is a smaller yet complete game in its own right, a dungeon crawler that takes place in SG's Underworld some twenty years prior to its events. Both games are being developed in concert, many of SG's more ambitious features will make an appearance in Exanima as development continues. Exanima provides a reasonably complete and meaningful game experience, but many more features are on their way! We have met our most challenging and significant development goals, now we are ready to bring new features to light and make an even more fun and compelling adventure. Here are some of the planned features, with many already being close to completion: Per session and global character skill progression Large non-linear main game following early content Build and permanently save characters by completing early content New encounters, items and environments Ranged combat and new close quarter manoeuvres Numerous moddable thaumaturgic powers More complete arena game modes featuring outdoor arenas Complex NPC interactions and dialogue Cooperative and competitive LAN multiplayer ",,"Minimum:,OS:,Windows XP (SP3),Processor:,Intel Core2 or AMD Athlon II dual core,Memory:,2 GB RAM,Graphics:,Intel HD 4000 or AMD Radeon HD 2600 or Nvidia GeForce 8600 with 512MB VRAM,Storage:,2 GB available space,Sound Card:,Integrated audio,Additional Notes:,Wine / CrossOver compatible on Mac OS X or Linux with appropriate OpenGL driver","Recommended:,Processor:,3 Ghz Intel Core i5 quad core or 3.5 Ghz AMD FX hex core or better,Graphics:,AMD Radeon HD 5850 or Nvidia GeForce GTX 280 with 1GB VRAM or better,Additional Notes:,Faster GPU with more VRAM recommended for very high settings or resolutions",$14.99,

There are many game modes available in TerraTech to stretch your Tech building imagination to the limits! Story In the distant future, Earth's natural resources have been depleted, and as a resource-gathering prospector it's your job to travel to alien planets and scour them for valuable materials. But you are not alone! Rival prospectors litter the landscapes of these new worlds, and will fight to protect what’s theirs, and invade to take what’s yours. To make your mark, you will need to be cunning and creative. Using the building blocks, guns, wheels, and wings from several Mining Corporations, you can build varied Techs to suit every purpose. Be it powerful armoured combat vehicles, unstoppable resource gathering machines, sprawling resource processing bases or a hybrid of all three - creativity is your key to exo-planetary success. The worlds in TerraTech are procedurally generated and infinite, so there are always new lands to discover and more resources to find. Treacherous mountain ranges, luscious grasslands and huge deserts are among the biomes you will encounter. More will be added as development progresses. The intergalactic mining industry is a profitable one, but you are not the only miner in search for new worlds to exploit. Defending yourself from rival miners will take time, resources and skill, with success leading to new territory and new lands. All equipable blocks and items can be damaged or destroyed, so ensuring you are sufficiently armed and ready for battle is a key element of both survival and prosperity in TerraTech. Get out there and show them who’s boss! By gathering and processing natural resources, players are able to construct storage, refining and construction bases in order to craft new blocks in the game. Like the look of that Venture Hail Fire Rifle that just tore your vehicle apart? Go prospecting for the needed resources, and craft a couple for yourself in the shiny new Venture fabricator which you just aquired, by beating their time trial challenge in the nearby mountains. All exo-planetary miners buy parts from the established Mining Corporations, which each have their own specific brand of mining technology. Get the job done with GSO, zoom around with high-performance recon specialists Venture, strip-mine to the max with the heavy-duty GeoCorp or act with miltary efficiency utilizing the stealth focussed Hawkeye. New Corporations we’re aiming to add to the game include deranged experimental scientists Reticule Research, technological superiority giants Better Future and the hive-mind AI swarms of LEGION. Completing missions and discovering blocks for each Corp will improve your standing with them, and gain access to the more sought-after components in their arsenal.

Conan Unconquered is a survival RTS set in the barbaric world of Conan the Barbarian where you must build your stronghold and assemble an unconquerable army to survive the savage hordes of Hyboria. Wave after wave of increasingly more difficult enemies will rush at your gates and you will need to manage resources, research new technologies to advance your defenses, and recruit an ever-growing army if you are to save survive utter destruction. You can choose to play the game entirely alone in single-player, but Conan Unconquered can also be enjoyed in full two-player co-op allowing for a truly unique, shared multiplayer experience. Players share a base where both can freely construct new buildings and amass an army to reach their common goal. The enemy hordes will keep coming at you and how long you can resist the invasion depends entirely on your ability to build your stronghold and lead your army. Gameplay is real-time, but you can also pause at any time to issue commands and start construction of new buildings. Battles will be bloody and savage with players having to deal with anything from fires raging through their stronghold to piles of corpses spreading death and disease. The savage horde is at your gates. Will you fall or will you remain unconquered? STAND AGAINST THE HORDE Battle wave after wave of increasingly more difficult enemies coming to destroy your stronghold, from lowly footmen to experienced elites and mighty siege weapons. Giant snakes and scorpions, spearmen, necromancers, and flying demons will arrive in vast numbers to see your home burn to the ground. BUILD AN UNCONQUERABLE STRONGHOLD Manage resources such as food, gold, wood, and iron to fuel your expanding stronghold. Construct a variety of different buildings from housing to temples and military barracks. Build defensive walls around your stronghold and equip them with traps such as oil cauldrons to keep attackers at bay. TWO-PLAYER CO-OP MULTIPLAYER Play together online and build a shared stronghold while fending off the enemy hordes. Both players can build structures freely, and research upgrades, walls, and structures are all shared allowing for a truly unique and cooperative multiplayer experience.  You can also try the game in challenge mode, where you can play the same maps as other players and see how well you compare to them. CONTROL LEGENDARY HEROES Heroes are incredibly powerful units that can greatly influence the outcome of battles. These heroes, including Conan himself, possess special abilities and you can equip them with unique artifacts that you find as you explore the world. ASSEMBLE AN UNCONQUERABLE ARMY You may start out with only a few foot soldiers, but before long you will have amassed an epic army of heavy cavalry, sorcerers, and more, ready at your command. Train units and keep them fed and paid to see their power grow and become truly unconquerable. SURVIVE DISEASE, FIRE, AND DEATH The world of Conan the Barbarian is one of blood, battle, and savagery. As your soldiers and those of your enemy die on the battlefield, their bodies will be left to rot and spread disease that can quickly turn the tide of war. Of course, a necromancer might be able to turn that to their advantage. EXPLORE THE ENVIRONMENT Randomly generated maps allow for infinite re-playability and each map holds vast opportunities for players that dare to explore beyond their stronghold. Discover ruins hiding great treasures, but beware: these are often protected by massive guardians that you need to bring down to claim your loot. CALL UPON THE GODS Build a temple and dedicate your stronghold to Mitra. Summon their massive avatar that towers above the battlefield and crushes your enemies in its footsteps.

While many were hopeful that diplomacy would finally end the war, differing opinions on what should be done, along with the depleted power of the controlling factions, has led to a splintering of the groups involved. The loyalist members of the Trader Emergency Coalition adopt a policy of isolation, focusing on enhanced defenses to ride out the rest of the war. Those who rebel against the coalition take on a purely militant view, coming to the opinion that the only way to bring peace is by ultimately crushing all who oppose them - especially xenos. For the first time in their history, the war creates a schism in the Advent Unity. The loyalists seek to continue their policy of revenge against the Traders, and to assimilate all others to the Unity’s influence. However, others amongst the Advent suspect that a corrupting influence from within has diverted the Unity from its proper destiny. The divide created in the Vasari Empire is less pronounced, but just as severe to their people. With the Vasari now practically frantic to move on to new space, the loyalist faction abandons cooperation and decides to take the resources they need by any means necessary. Having accepted the need to work together, the rebel faction feels that their best chance for survival is to work with the other races and bring them along to flee the approaching enemy. Take the battle for galactic supremacy to its ultimate level in Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion – a standalone RT4X game that combines the tactics of real-time strategy with the depth of the 4X genre (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, eXterminate). Key features: New Factions :  Decide whether to play as a Loyalist or Rebel – each unlocks new technologies, ships and play styles for each race. New Titan Class Warships :  Mighty titans enter the fray of the war to tip the scales of power. Each faction may field their own unique titan, drawing upon unique strengths and abilities on the battlefield. New and Updated Capital Ships :  A new capital ship joins the fleet for each race to offer even more tactical options. Additionally, all existing capital ships have been upgraded to four levels for their abilities, allowing players to focus their ships along specific strengths. New Corvette Class Ships :  Small and maneuverable, each faction has developed a new light attack craft to harass enemy forces. Updated Visuals :  Updated graphics, particle effects, lighting and shadows, race specific UI and other enhancements make the Sins’ universe look better than ever. New Victory Conditions :  Take multiple paths to victory including – Military, Diplomatic, Research, Last Flagship Standing, Last Capital Standing and Occupation. New Audio :  More than 60 minutes of original music, countless new sound effects and dozens of new voice overs help bring the drama of battle to new levels of immersion. Tutorials :  New and updated tutorials make it easy for both experienced and new players to quickly start building their own solar empire.

Your reporting team is hacking away in the background as corporate music plays through the loudspeaker. It's time to make decisions. Will you endorse nationalized healthcare, even though your love interest is worried about increased wait times? Will you demonize the new synthetic alcoholic drink, even though your boss stressed they are an important investor? Will you support current government, as tensions grow between the neighboring country? After work, you emerge on the streets of Novistan, shaped by the very news you publish. Perhaps you will see more graffiti, angry bums or even a riot? Or perhaps you will turn the nation into peaceful utopia, filled with cameras and drones watching your every step? How will your channel address tragic events about to happen? Will you agree to meet the clandestine group of truthtellers, or stop to watch the Prime Minister's speech? On the way home you meet with three main characters: Evie, your co-worker and immigrant, worried about her health and growing xenophobic sentiment; your brother Justin, an aspiring comedian struggling with impostor syndrome and social anxiety; finally Rudy, a single father trying to provide for his little girl and keep his store afloat, while a mega-mart opens up next door. Each day provides a glimpse into their life and how the media shapes their beliefs. But every Headliner deserves to relax at home from the stress of the job. Listen to the radio and unwind on the comfy couch bought with hard-earned cash, as you watch the city burn outside the window. Perhaps splurge on treats to feed your doggo? Adopt a drone? Have your brother over for dinner? Or maybe keep your doors locked, hoarding every penny, as your apartment slowly fills with piles of cash?

It is the year 518. The rebellion of the renegade mages, known as the Mage Wars, has been quashed by the Crown.

In times like these people cling to any sign of hope they can find. The Purity of Light, led by a charismatic man called  Rondar Lacaine, claims that mages are the source of all misfortune – and that only the second coming of Aonir, the father of all gods, will return Eo to its former splendor. The story takes place before the acclaimed SpellForce: The Order of Dawn .

The wind rages outside the thin walls of your wooden cabin. A wolf howls in the distance. You look at the meagre supplies in your pack, and wish for the days before the power mysteriously went out. How much longer will you survive? Welcome to THE LONG DARK , the innovative exploration-survival experience Wired magazine calls ""the pinnacle of an entire genre"". The Long Dark is a thoughtful, exploration-survival experience that challenges solo players to think for themselves as they explore an expansive frozen wilderness in the aftermath of a geomagnetic disaster. There are no zombies -- only you, the cold, and all the threats Mother Nature can muster. The episodic story-mode for The Long Dark, WINTERMUTE, includes two of the five episodes that form its Season One. Both episodes were given a complete overhaul in December 2018, as part of the Redux Update: new mission structure, story beats, dialogue, animations etc. EPISODE ONE - “Do Not Go Gentle” Bush pilot Will Mackenzie (player character) and Dr. Astrid Greenwood are separated after their plane crashes deep in the Northern Canadian wilderness in the aftermath of a mysterious flash of light in the sky. Struggling to survive as he desperately searches for Astrid, Mackenzie comes across the small town of Milton, where he begins to understand the scope of this quiet apocalypse. EPISODE TWO - “Luminance Fugue” Mackenzie’s search for Astrid takes him deeper into the savage Winter wilderness. A mysterious trapper may be the key to finding Astrid, but can he be trusted? The first two episodes of WINTERMUTE represent approximately 15 hours of gameplay. Episodes Three to Five are included in the price of the game, and will be unlocked for free as they are released. Features performances by Jennifer Hale, Mark Meer, David Hayter, and Elias Toufexis (Episode Three), and the music of Cris Velasco. Survival Mode is the free-form, non-narrative survival sandbox that has been honed over nearly three years in Early Access. Survival is your only goal, and death your only end. Make your own survival story with every game. NO HAND HOLDING The game challenges players to think for themselves by providing the information but never the answers. You have to earn the right to survive. PERMADEATH When you die in Survival Mode, your save is deleted. Every decision matters. [Note that WINTERMUTE does not feature permadeath. CONDITION & CALORIES Monitor your Hunger, Thirst, Fatigue, and Cold as you struggle to balance resources with the energy needed to obtain them. Every action costs Calories, and time is your most precious resource. Choose your path carefully. SCOUR THE WORLD FOR SUPPLIES Over 100 gear items including Tools, Light Sources, Weapons, First Aid supplies, Clothing, and more. A VAST LIVING WORLD Explore a 50 square kilometre Northern Canadian wilderness in search of precious supplies. In Winter. Dynamic time of day, weather, wildlife presence, etc. provide just enough randomness to keep things challenging. SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST Hunt, fish, trap, climb, map, search for life-saving food and gear items, and try to avoid dying from the hostile wildlife, succumbing to hypothermia, frostbite, or dysentery (amongst other uncomfortable afflictions), find and maintain your life-saving gear. Hunt and be hunted by: Wolves, Bears, Moose, Rabbits, Deers, Crows, and more to come in future updates. CHOOSE YOUR EXPERIENCE Four distinct Experience Modes let you find a challenge level you are comfortable with, such as Pilgrim Mode, which is meant to be quiet and pensive, all the way to Interloper Mode, where only the most experienced survivors have a chance to last a week.

Not just in character, you are the character. The part to play is singularly yours. Written just for you. You are met with silence. No barking orders from the director. No call to action that you need to become this version of yourself. The demand to act fills your mind, but the script pages hold no words. Your past has helped to mold you into what you are, forced upon you the skills required to hone your craft. That same past has scraped deep furrowing scars into you, not on the outside where the world can see, but in a place buried so deep within that it has become shapeless. You push those memories down but let the experiences drive you into who, or what, you must play. Darkness surrounds as you stand silently in the spotlight, the only sounds to be heard over your heartbeat are the distant breaking of waves against the hull and the sound of cameras pointed in your direction preserving this moment for eternity. A deep and commanding voice rises from the distance. Act. What part will you play? Game Features: Story-driven exploration - You must explore the world around you. Discover your past, and expose the reason for your having been cast for this film. Psychological horror - Is this part of the film, or are your memories playing tricks on you?

In the 31st century the battlefields are dominated by immense and powerful mechanized units called BattleMechs. Join the ranks of elite operators tasked with piloting these war machines. Choose your path to becoming the most feared MechWarrior in the Inner Sphere, fighting for battlefield supremacy against other players. Enter the Solaris Arena. The newest addition to MechWarrior online™, Solaris 7, features 1 vs 1 and 2 vs 2 Mech Combat across 7 Divisions. Choose your BattleMech wisely, each of the 7 Divisions has a limited roster of BattleMechs available based on the Mech’s performance capabilities on the battlefield. Take a Patron Contract, pick up sponsors, and earn accolades as you climb to the top of the Divisions Leaderboards. Solaris 7 features 5 maps tailored for intense Mech Combat. Quick Play is where you'll find fast action, fielding a single 'Mech in team-based game modes and maps. Unlike Faction Play, Quick Play matches do not influence the layout of Inner Sphere territories; these battles are fought purely for rewards and glory. In Faction Play you will field 4 ‘Mechs per match, lending your skills and allegiance to the Faction of your choosing in prolonged team-based engagements, conquering and defending planets in their name to earn rewards and expand your Faction's territory across the Inner Sphere. Gameplay Piloting a 'Mech to victory requires a mastery of tactical positioning, teamwork, and firing discipline. Strike out as a Lone Wolf or seek out one of the many player-controlled Units and fight under the banners of powerful galactic empires for prestige, wealth, or nothing more than the sheer thrill of battle. Next Gen Mobility - By the 31st century, tanks have evolved to take on humanoid shape, their treads replaced with nimble legs. Like modern tanks, 'Mechs move their upper torso and weapons independently of their legs offering unparalleled mobility while exchanging fire. Depending on their size, BattleMechs travel at vastly different speeds and offer different systems like jump jets to aid in their locomotion. Make Every Shot Count - Pilots must balance mobility and damage output against the amount of heat generated from their weapons fire and 'Mech operation, lest they risk the temporary loss of power that comes when a 'Mech overheats. Firing all weapons simultaneously (known as an Alpha Strike) can be the quickest way to devastate an opponent, but may leave a 'Mech helpless against its enemies if the heat sinks can't handle the stress. Fight Smart - 'Mechs possess both external armor and strong internal structural elements to help minimize the chance of a 'quick kill'. As a result, pilots must treat each encounter with the utmost attention and awareness, prioritizing weaker or more critical components before delivering the killing blow. Communication among teammates and the effective use of targeting systems can help to identify vulnerable 'Mechs and components. Teamwork is the Difference - Targeting a 'Mech will automatically allow your teammates to achieve their own lock, allowing them to ascertain vital location data, armor status, and loadout details for the targeted enemy. Information Warfare can be a vital component for victory, providing attack-focused allies with the necessary information to tear their opponents to pieces. Information Warfare - While fast-moving scouts feed target and tactical information back to the main battle group and the team commander, long-range Support and heavy-hitting Brawler and Assault ‘Mechs will use this information to position themselves for the perfect strike. Pilots can also shield themselves and allies from enemy sensors and weapons fire using various counter measures. It is up to each pilot to customize their BattleMech loadout to fulfill their desired role. Find the perfect 'Mech - Hundreds of unique 'Mechs are available, offering a wide range of strengths and weaknesses. Smaller 'Mechs should never stop moving, and can rely on their sheer speed to overwhelm heavier opponents. Larger 'Mechs move slow and deliberate but can stand toe-to-toe with other large opponents. Acquire and test different 'Mechs to find those that best suit your play style. Choose Your Allegiance - Work for the powerful empires of the galaxy to earn their loyalty and spread their influence across the stars. Band together with other pilots using the Looking For Group feature, or use the Faction Chat feature to coordinate offensive and defensive strategies to capture or defend worlds and shift the balance of power. Get Rewarded - Pilots earn ComStar Bills (C-Bills) from playing matches and completing faction contracts, which can be used to purchase new 'Mechs and equipment. Certain items can only be purchased using premium 'Mech Credits (MC). MC can either be purchased directly via real world money or acquired in smaller increments in-game by earning reputation with a Faction in Faction Play, or as rewards from participating in special Events. 'Mech Experience (XP) gained during combat is applied to the 'Mech used during that match, and can be used to unlock improvements to various BattleMech systems. MechWarrior Online™ also includes a host of achievements to unlock that will challenge even the most skilled players.",,"Minimum:,Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system,OS:,64-Bit Windows 7,Processor:,Intel: Core 2 Duo E7300 @ 2.66 GHz / AMD: Athlon 64 X2 6400+ @ 3.2GHz,Memory:,4 GB RAM,Graphics:,NVIDIA: 8800 GT / AMD: Radeon HD 5670,DirectX:,Version 9.0c,Network:,Broadband Internet connection,Storage:,16 GB available space,Additional Notes:,45GB temporarily required during installation","Recommended:,Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system,OS:,64-Bit Windows 10,Processor:,Intel: Core i5-3470 @ 3.20 GHz / AMD: FX-6300 @ 3.5 GHz,Memory:,8 GB RAM,Graphics:,NVIDIA: GeForce GTX 660 / AMD: Radeon HD 7870,DirectX:,Version 11,Network:,Broadband Internet connection,Storage:,45 GB available space",Free to Play,

Things are changing from bad to worse and the odds are stacked against you. A duel with an enemy you can’t kill. Your main foe is the plague itself, an incorporeal and malevolent entity that you have to defeat… without having the means to. It’s more powerful and more treacherous than you can imagine. Loot, murder, mug, steal, barter, beg… or don’t. You need resources to survive, and it’s up to you how to obtain them. The fights are short, ungraceful, and vicious. They’re not always lethal though.

Players will relive the events of ‘Operation Market Garden’ across the fields and towns of Holland. This massive Allied assault consisted of a coordination of the British and American Airborne to capture key bridges while the British XXX Corps moved to reinforce them through Highway 69. However, consecutive delays in consolidating ground from the north of Belgium through Nijmegen forced the 1st British Airborne Division in Arnhem to make a stand much longer than anticipated. With no successful link between the XXX Corps and the Airborne in sight, the seventh and final bridge in Arnhem was considered lost. ‘The Bloody Seventh’ is our name for the initial focus of the project as we feel it succinctly details the struggle that the British paratroopers had to endure while waiting for their army counterpart to establish a link through the lower Rhine. Players will be given the option to fight with the British Airborne Division, British XXX Corps, 82nd US Airborne, 101st US Airborne or several branches of the German Army, such as the Wehrmacht or the Waffen SS. It’s a rare opportunity to experience the intense battlefield that was Operation Market Garden, which stretched across farms, woods, villages and city areas. Each area is being accurately recreated from archival references that range from street level to aerial images.

It is a survival sandbox with crew management mechanics while its primary theme is life of German sailors. The boat is their home, but it can become their grave at any time. In UBOAT you control the crew in order to control the boat. You look after their physical and mental health, because if the sailors are hungry, tired and their spirit is low, there’s no chance of winning even a skirmish. Survival The extensive damage system is a foundation of the game's survival elements. Unprecedented situations are bound to happen as the effect of received damage, testing player's creativity and ability to stay calm. You can try to save the whole crew or leave someone behind, to save the others. While your ship travels through the open seas, you will often find yourself being on your own. Use your management skills to spend resources taken on the trip optimally and in special cases try to recover them on the sea, by asking your allies for the help... or by looting wreckages of enemy ships. Disable unnecessary devices, to keep your accumulators running for longer. Tell your crew to stay in their bunks to preserve oxygen. If crew's morale is low - play with them a session of Skat or play music from nearby radio stations, to fortify their hearts. Kriegsmarine career During the playthrough you will receive assignments from the Kriegsmarine headquarters. They are never linear and you may receive additional orders during them or face unexpected problems. Brave completion of assignments from the headquarters is rewarded with additional budget for the unit under your command and with acceptance of your growing reputation as an u-boat's skipper. You will need that, to upgrade your ship and keep up with enemy's technological advances. Upgrade your boat for the rewarded funds. Receive additional permissions for the reputation points. Buy new equipment - new torpedo types, sonar decoys, CO2 absorbers and much more. Send your officers on special tasks in the headquarters to, among other things, speed up a research of new technologies. Accurate simulation Game's simulation elements are very realistic, but that never comes at a cost of gameplay quality. Despite extensive simulation elements, UBOAT can be played like a regular game and complex matters can be learned later to become a better skipper for the commanded unit. Even small things like the influence of ballast in each compartment on the ship's trim (tilt) or Earth's curvature are faithfully reproduced in the game. Perfection can be achieved in many ways. Prove your management skills and swiftly assign work to your officers to speed things up. If, on the other hand, you think that if something needs to be done, it's better to do that on your own - sit behind the periscope, hydrophone or 88 mm deck gun and take matters in your own hands!

Of course the world ends. It was just a question of time. Extreme climate change, global economic crisis, a lethal pandemic, and increasing tension between old and new superpowers. For the first time since 1945 nuclear weapons were used in armed conflict. Mushroom clouds rose from east to west before the dust settled. Now it’s over and the Earth is still. Nature has invaded ruined cities. Wind sweeps through empty streets, turned into graveyards. The humans are all gone. Scavenging through the remains of civilization are the Mutants, deformed humanoids and animals alike, searching for salvation or just something to eat. To survive, you and your companions must venture out to explore the Zone. Maybe one day you will find the Eden of legends, the ancients’ haven in the middle of hell. That’s where truth awaits, the stories say. Maybe you will find your answers there. Then again, maybe it’s all bullshit. TACTICAL COMBAT Mutant Year Zero: Road to Eden is the ultimate fix for your tactical strategy addiction. Dive into a deep, turn-based, tactical combat system inspired by the XCOM games. EXPLORE A POST-HUMAN EARTH  Journey through a post-human world of abandoned cities, crumbling highways, and overgrown countryside. Check back at the Ark, a neon-bathed oasis of ill repute and questionable characters, to restock your supplies and plan out your next adventure. CONTROL A TEAM OF MUTANTS A duck with an attitude problem and a boar with anger issues; these aren’t your typical heroes. Get to know Dux, Bormin, Selma, and many other characters each with their own unique personality and deranged perspective on the world and their situation. MASTER THE STEALTHY APPROACH Sneak through shadows to avoid conflict or to catch enemies unaware. Real-time stealth allows you full control of approach: sneak into an enemy camp, position the team of Mutants to your advantage, and gain the element of surprise. UNLOCK MUTATIONS Unlock new mutations and abilities for your Mutants, such as Selma’s grasping vines, Bormin’s Charge, and Dux‘ uncanny ability to sneak into a camp full of enemies unnoticed, despite being a 4-foot tall walking, talking duck with a crossbow. DYNAMIC ENVIRONMENT Use the environment to your advantage. Stay out of floodlights, hide from line of sight, or just blast down fully destructible walls and buildings and wreak utter havoc. LOOT, LOOT EVERYWHERE From makeshift slingshots to high-powered rifles and top hats to police vests, make sure you equip your Mutants for the dangers ahead.

Reroute power between ship systems, scan alien planets for lifeforms, run powerful programs to change the tide of battle, or start up the warp drive to escape a conflict you cannot win. The strategies you use are up to you—or your Captain. Embark on missions, investigate abandoned stations, and scavenge for components that could aid you in your voyage. Teleport down to the surfaces of alien planets, where you may face extreme environments and dangerous creatures. Trek across the galaxy, and discover what lies on its fringes.

Not at this time. We are planning on integrating one in the future, however we want to make sure most of the ship systems are finalized before building it. If you want to learn about how to play and use the various ship systems, you can click here to view the manual! Can I stream and/or monetize game footage? Yes! This is our written permission to do so. Simulation or Game? We like using the term simulation because it helps convey the fact that each starship is a large collection of systems and mechanics working together and reacting to its environment. However, this is a game first and foremost. Because of that, we aren't afraid to go outside the realms of reality if it makes the experience more enjoyable. This is not a 100% realistic simulation, it's a game with simulated elements. Player versus player modes? PULSAR was designed from the ground up to be cooperative in nature. None of the mechanics are prepared to handle the specific challenges of PvP combat. We believe that this focus on pure cooperation will enable us to create an experience that is unique and feasible by our small team. Singleplayer? We are focusing on a multiplayer experience at this time. We do offer AI crew bots that can take over unfilled roles, but they are very much a work in progress. The game is very teamwork heavy so the recommended experience is with multiple people. If you looking for a more complete singleplayer experience, you may want to consider waiting until the AI is fully developed. Where can I get more information? For more information, check out these links below: Classes Factions Roadmap Manual Forums The game is currently under development. New systems and mechanics are still being added and tweaked, and there is not a large amount of in-game content to see yet. If you prefer to play more complete games and have no desire to be part of the testing / feedback process of a game in development, we highly recommend waiting until the game is more complete before considering a purchase.

But the environment has been setup to cause conflict amongst the group, creating doubt about the true intentions of players. The infected will be busy collecting bloody and trying to cover up their sabotage attempts, whilst the innocents will be keeping an eye out for suspicious behaviour and attempting to make alliances with those they think they can trust.

Verdun is the first multiplayer FPS set in a realistic World War One setting, the game which started the WW1 Game series. The vicious close quarters nature of trench warfare means that skill with a bayonet can be as vital as good aim with a rifle. The game offers 5 distinct game-modes with many historically accurate features such as realistic WW1 weaponry, authentic uniforms, horrendous gore, and maps based on the real battlefields of France and Belgium. The dynamic Frontlines game mode features 64 players taking turns to go over the top and attempt to capture the opposing trench line. Verdun key features include: Experience World War One gameplay: Accurate weaponry with realistic bullet physics, skill based weapon handling, poisonous gas with a claustrophobic gas mask experience, horrendous gore effects, and ferocious artillery barrages Tactical squad-based FPS: 15 distinctive squad types representing soldiers from 5+ countries, each with distinct weapons and equipment True trench warfare: Real-time dynamic frontline with momentum based attack and counter-attack gameplay Authentic World War 1 setting: Typical WW1 music and style, historical battlefields representing the key theaters on the Western Front Challenging game modes: Team-based Frontlines, tactical Attrition, and skill-based Rifle Deathmatch, desperate survival in Squad Defense and epic 64 player Frontlines including bot support. WW1 on the Western Front The gameplay in this true WW1 battlefield experience is as immersive and gritty as it can get, with features such as optional realistic gore which portrays the true horror of the First World War and authentic weaponry including artillery and gas. Weapons need to be handled with skill - each gun handles differently and there are no floating crosshairs to aid your aim, along with realistic bullet physics to contend with. Battle your way across no man’s land to capture the next enemy trench line, before switching to defense to protect your gains in the Frontlines game mode. Keep your head down or quickly don your mask in the event of artillery strikes or gas attacks. This unforgiving war isn’t for the faint hearted! Authentic World War One Setting The WW1 Game Series currently includes Verdun and Tannenberg (set on the Eastern Front). These authentic WW1 shooters let players choose from a range of squads from across the war, as they fight for control of the ever-changing frontlines. For Verdun, we carried out extensive field research at the battlefield itself and were advised by knowledgeable historians to make sure the individual elements in Verdun are as historically accurate as it can get. Uniforms have been recreated to the tiniest detail, the weapons are modeled to exact references and the maps use realistic props and terrain layouts. Everything in the game has been tailored to recreate the grim atmosphere so typical of WW1, from the immersive interface and war torn maps to realistic sounds and voices that evoke the feeling of actually being there in the mud covered trenches, peering out over no man's land in search of the enemy.

CHOOSE YOUR LEGION Each Legion has its own play style in tune with their history and key characters:  Sons of Horus : the Warmaster’s own legion, specializing in decapitating strikes against the enemy warlord.  Emperor’s Children : pursuers of perfection, rewarded with powerful bonuses from playing perfect turns.  Death Guard : masters of attrition and chemical warfare, increasingly corrupted by the Chaos God of Decay to become immortal.  World Eaters : war dogs that do away with the nuances of strategy in favor of fearsome charges and close combat massacres.  Iron Hands : relentless and growing stronger the longer they stay in the field, building up overwhelming momentum that tramples everything in their path.  Raven Guard : guerrilla experts that excel at hit-and-run tactics and stealth operations, emboldened by a thirst for justice against the enemies they sentence to death.  Salamanders : innate survivors, they can overcome punishment that would wipe out other Astartes, and then burn those who dared fight them.  Iron Warriors : tempered and dispassionate, they approach warfare with cold logic and excel in siege warfare, disregarding their own losses as long as victory is achieved.  Alpha Legion : Secrecy is their weapon. It’s hard to tell who you’re fighting, as they all claim to be Alpharius. Watch out, they may have agents in your ranks...  Night Lords : They come unseen and terrorize their opponents so that they can’t fight back. In addition, three Neutral factions provide support for all Legions that want it:  Chaos : the Chaos Gods are aiding Horus and his allies, but the Loyalists aren’t immune to corruption. The power of chaos, however, can be fatally unwieldy.  Imperial Army : the countless men and women unable to compete against the Astartes in single combat, but who can overwhelm them with sheer numbers and ingenuity.  Mechanicum : seekers of knowledge from the Dark Age of Technology who supply weapons and vehicles, as well as aiding with their own armies and Titan Legions. More Legions will come in future expansions!

But that old black ocean beckons, and there’s loot for the brave souls who dare to sail her. Seek out intriguing individuals for your crew Hire unique officers like the Haunted Doctor and the Irrepressible Cannoneer. Each has a story to tell, if you can draw it out of them. Stray from the gas-lamps of civilisation Light and dark, terror and madness: spend too long on the wide, dark sea and your crew will grow fearful and eventually lose their sanity. Carve a life for your captain in a cruel and unique world A deep, compelling world packed with 350,000+ words of stories and secrets. Find your father’s bones. Determine London’s destiny. Defy the gods of the deep sea. Your captain will die. Pass on resources from one generation to the next. Acquire a family home and a hoard of heirlooms. Build a legacy of zailors who braved the sea and lost - or, occasionally, won. Features Beautiful, hand drawn art - castles of sparkling ice, prisons perched on lily pads, fog-shrouded lighthouses and the DAWN MACHINE. Real-time combat against ships and Zee-beasts, spider-crewed dreadnoughts and sentient icebergs. Upgrade your steamship with powerful engines, cannons and pneumatic torpedo guns. (Or buy a bigger, better ship.) Choose a ship’s mascot: the Comatose Ferret, the Wretched Mog, the Elegiac Cockatoo, and more! Trade or smuggle silk and souls, mushroom wine and hallucinogenic honey.

Using old school command prompts and real hacking processes, you’ll solve the mystery with minimal hand-holding and a rich world full of secrets to explore. Bit, a hacker responsible for creating the most invasive security system on the planet, is dead. When he fails to reconnect to his system for 14 days, his failsafe kicks in, sending instructions in automated emails to a lone user.  As that user, it’s up to you to unravel the mystery and ensure that Hacknet-OS doesn't fall into the wrong hands. Exploring the volatile nature of personal privacy, the prevalence of corporate greed, and the hidden powers of hackers on the internet, Hacknet delivers a true hacking simulation, while offering a support system that allows total beginners get a grasp of the real-world applications and commands found throughout the game. Features Real Hacking Based on actual UNIX commands, Hacknet focuses on real hacking, not the Hollywood-style version of it. This creates a truly immersive experience and puts players right in the thick of trying to break through the firewalls. Unlock the mystery of Bit A hacker is dead and the media reports don’t add up. When you are contacted by his “ghost” - an automated failsafe system - you’re drawn into the dark and murky world of underground hackers. Full immersion You are thrust into a persistent virtual world with no “levels” or obvious game elements to break the illusion. Follow the guidance of the emails from Bit or just dive down the rabbit hole, chasing down clues and snippets of information you find as you explore different systems.

That means: ➣ Sprawling levels that offer a degree of freedom and don't hold the player's hand. Exploring, hunting secrets, backtracking, patience and having to figure out what to do next is key. Monsters and pickups are hand-placed and vary according to the difficulty you play on. ➣ Original story packed with lots of lore and doubled by a permeating atmosphere. Intensive attention to detail and world building. ➣ Gory, fast paced shooting, a solid arsenal of weapons and magic items. Combat is projectile-based, movement is essential, enemies are unique and vary in type and abilities. ➣ Original soundtrack ranging from tense to serene ambient, spiced up with bursts of metal. Also, did I mention the legendary Alexander Brandon? If you enjoyed the Unreal and Deus Ex soundtracks, you're in for a treat! ➣ Thousands of hours of work put into an original concept, digitally hand-drawn graphics (textures, sprites, frame by frame animations etc.), scripting, sound effects and level design, all by a one man dev team aiming to create a unique game with a unique atmosphere. ➣ Six to eight hours of good 'ol singleplayer action with five difficulties including Brutalizing, which changes the gameplay to allow interesting second playthroughs (different fights & pick-ups, companions etc.). ➣ It's very light on storage (under 300mb) and well optimized. It's also portable so no DRM and no online ties either - you buy it, it's yours! My aim is to research classic game design and refresh the valuable bits we've lost in an experience that ultimately rewards the player through learning and investment rather than through mechanically administered gratification. Hedon is an oldschool game, and that's pretty much enough of a description. You will be dropped in a hostile world that has its own workings, characters and intrigues, and you will be expected to fend for yourself. The build up is slow and steady, the story is consistent, the combat is fast paced and ruthless. You will sometimes find yourself lost in a non linear level design with various aesthetics (forest, caves, forge, barracks, snowy mountain etc.) where exploration and learning by yourself is the key to improve. You may find that Hedon takes a certain amount of atmosphere, gameplay, color and inspiration from games such as Unreal, Blood, Thief, Arx Fatalis, Serious Sam etc. but nonetheless aims to be original at all times. You play as Zan (any similarity with the creator's username is a pure coincidence), a half Orc - half Demon warrior who wakes up in a caved in tunnel with no memory of how she ended up there. The first episode will focus on our hero's descent into a strange underground world which is threatened by the sudden attack of a massive Cultist force. There are certain races and factions populating the world of Hedon. The Iron Division A faction of amazon-like Orcs and Goblins, the Iron Division are the keepers Hedon's greatest secret - the crystal technology. Various magical crystals sprawl across the underground, providing energy, heat, oxygen and often forming entire biomes around them. Combining this power with crafting and the ancient art of magic, the Iron Division has founded a whole new civilization within their mountain stronghold known as Valc. The Cultists Fallen to sin, the raving husks of what were once human now worship various figures of the Underworld. Little can be done to cull their addiction to pain and suffering. Little but a spray of frag fire or an explosive bolt that is... The Demons Chaotic Demons dwell in the deepest parts of Hedon, lashing out at the weaker minds of the inhabitants of the Overworld. Along the ages, they have subdued entire towns to become their cultist slaves and feed their endless hunger through pain and suffering. Demons only care about feeding, and they will stop at nothing to do so. The Earthborn Ancient dwellers of the underground, Minotaurs and Dwarves have built their own civilizations, ever clenched in warfare with the Demons spawning from below. However, their great cities and heritage were lost hundreds of years after their inevitable defeat in front of Hell's armies, and now they have been scattered and forced to live in small clans and towns. iamfailtacular - story collaboration/world building, brainstorming Akhzul - Hedon's OST dedicated composer. A one guitar man band. Alexander Brandon - The man himself. If you enjoyed the soundtracks of Deus Ex or Unreal, then you're in for a few pleasant surprises. I bought few licenses for some of his personal tracks (and other songs that didn't make it in Deus Ex/Unreal) and fit them into Hedon! Breathelast - A band of underground sharks who pitched in with instrumental tracks of their songs. Also one of my favorite bands ever. Methadone Skies - Another solid band from the underground, guilty of creating dreamlike musical atmosphere. Shivaxi & Xenofish - 5 Michelin Star chef and his cool friend who made an awesome remix for Alexander Brandon's Underworld.

Rulers will need all the strength of their subjects to sail away and find new kingdoms in these New Lands. Kingdom: New Lands builds upon the award-winning gameplay and mystery of Kingdom by introducing an abundance of new content to the IGF-nominated title while maintaining the simplicity and depth that legions of monarchs have come to experience and enjoy. Travel to the New Lands and welcome the deluge of new mounts, merchants, and vagrants that call these isles home, but be wary of the new obstacles that threaten your arrival -- for not just the greedy creatures block your way but even the environment itself can defeat you. Kingdom: New Lands asks you to puzzle things out on your own. You'll come across items, NPCs, and mysterious statues to help you but you'll have to figure out just how exactly they'll aide you in building and defending your Kingdom. Kingdom: New Lands is about exploration, discovery, survival and that awesome feeling that you get, when you figure something out, on your own. When multiple pieces all of a sudden come together to form a whole – a basis for a new strategy or an understanding how something in the world of Kingdom: New Lands truly works. It is about tenacity and overcoming obstacles – even when they seem to be unsurmountable. Pulling through, against all odds. Rebuilding and recovering. And that huge internal high-five when you succeed. It is about figuring out how best to manage your little Kingdom and tie everything together in a fashion where the game doesn’t play you – you play the game. It’s also beautiful, tranquil, melancholy, frantic, stressful and wonderful. It delivers a spectrum of emotions that combine into a unique experience. It's a minimalist strategy game where you need to discover the rules of how the world behaves before you can rule effectively. It's also a little bit whimsical, it's pretty, and it can be frustrating but it won't hold your hand. Kingdom: New Lands features: Look, we REALLY didn't want to have to give you a feature list... but if you insist... ● One ruler, their horse, and a bag of coins ● Greedy creatures trying to take your coins and crown every night (stop them!) ● Loyal subjects who will help build, attack and defend your Kingdom ● Multiple upgrades for your homestead, different unit types to attack and defend, and secrets littered throughout the land ● Beautiful soundtrack that has received two honorable mentions from the Independent Games Festival Be brave, ruler, and fight to the bitter end, lest these New Lands conquer you instead.

A more detailed look at the alpha version of the game: °  Three different AI storytellers: Cora Core, Tranquillio Pax and RNGesus Silvius. Each provide different types of game play experience, from a nice curve of rising difficulty, to a chill sandbox experience, to something not even RNGesus can predict. °  Harvest several types of minerals and alien flora. °  Build modular buildings such as assemblers, floors, walls and so on, to construct a base. °  Craft items, blueprints and ammo. °  Manage your needs, such as hunger, thirst, rest and leisure. °  Survive raids made of space pirates or wildlife. °  Current events: - Raids: Air or ground, by the local wildlife or space mercs. These space mercs can come in spaceships to rain down fire on your base, or drop down directly on the planet and get personal. - Nox event: Poisonous meteorite explodes in the atmosphere, enveloping the atmosphere in poison and slowly killing all that breathes. - Solar flare: Causes fire tornadoes that can in turn cause fire that spreads on almost anything, including animals who in turn spread the fire themselves if they catch it. - Meteor shower: Mostly visual, but also provides a nice boost to your well being while it's active. - Trade ships: Trade with the different factions. °  Day and night cycle with amazing (summer only for now) weather and cloud system. This is not just a visual only thing; it does affect gameplay. A rainy weather will put out fire while at night your solar panels won't work. Wind influences the efficiency of your turbines. °  Play and explore a different map every time you want to start a new game. Yes, almost everything is procedural. °  Grow your own food. °  Manage your electrical system to make sure all buildings have enough energy to work. °  Gaia contains intelligent AI, such as coward AI (for example, deer) that runs away from you if you come too close, passive AI like most other wildlife, aggressive AI like most monsters and all space pirates, or territorial AI like wolves and sand scorpions. Gaia is designed to invoke feelings of adventure , survival and triumph. Inspired from games such as Rimworld, tower defense games, RPG games and even Paradox games, Gaia has a bit of everything. From the sandbox experience of Minecraft, the wave survival of tower defense games, to the beautiful graphics of RPGs like Skyrim and Subnautica,, the game will provide a unique gameplay experience. Amanda has her own needs that affect gameplay , such as hunger and thirst. Make sure you eat prepared food, drink water, rest from time to time, relax by watching the sunset, going to the bathroom when needed and washing your hands. Failure to do so will cause problems, such as decreasing your max health, running speed or mental health, which itself can cause some pretty serious issues. The map is generated every time you want to start a new game, which means you'll get a new gameplay experience every single time. Your starting location affects your playing experience, as you may start off on a beach near the ocean or somewhere inland in a dense or sparse forest. Each map comes with its own challenges and advantages and it's up to you to adapt to the situation. Only the topography is static, i.e. the ground. Gaia has a complex weather system , containing a day night cycle and a date system, wind, rain and temperature. These factors affect Amanda as well as how some of your buildings work, like turbines. Make sure you take into account all of this when deciding what to build or what to do at any given time during the day. Grow your own food and cook complex recipes , some which may require alien flora or alien meat. Every vegetable you grow has its own advantages or disadvantages, such as nutrition, time of growth and amount of harvest. Choose between corn, chili, carrots, onions, cabbage or even leeks. The goal with Gaia is to provide an experience that is as realistic as it can be. In its current state, Early Access, the game can go in many different ways. You, the reader, can get involved with the community and have a say in which direction the game goes. What should be prioritized? What would you like to see in a game like this? Do you want to be a tester or to showcase the game in a youtube video? There is a website and a forum where you can get involved and contribute to the path Gaia is taking.

Instead of discrete units that attack your base, a fluid-like substance spreads over the terraformable terrain.  Your base, your weapons, your strategy... you must adapt them all. Creeper World 3 bends what it means to be a strategy title. Instead of heavily scripted A.I., players find themselves engaging an enemy with theoretically predictable behavior yet which is shockingly interesting to engage. Players can build fortifications and stick around forever.  Players can go for domination, quick strategic kills, or amass huge stockpiles of resources.  Some play for speed, others to create art.  Tiny maps, large maps, five minute missions, five day missions...  the simulation scales to handle all of these scenarios. User generated content is critical and supported at multiple levels in Creeper World 3. Dial up worlds using the DMD (Dial Map Device) and tweak dozens of constraints.  Then, play and share the addresses via an on-line database.  Create your own maps using the built-in map editor and upload and share on-line.  Or, join with thousands of other players and peruse the databases of worlds created by others.  Want to create a new weapon, a unit, an enemy, or an effect?  Use the built in scripting language to create what you dream.  Hundreds of engine commands are exposed and examples abound on the forums and grow daily.  You can even take the built in story maps and make your own.  In fact, all of the built in story missions were written using the built-in editor and the CRPL scripting language. Some of the high level features are: Thermodynamic/fluid physics based play. Billions of total missions. Story arc with insane and unique enemies. Explore hundreds of star systems with thousands of worlds in Prospector missions. Hundreds of hand crafted missions in the Alpha Sector. Dial up your own mission worlds using the 'Dial Map Device' and share the address. Create your own maps using the included map editor. Play on maps of variable size, dimension, and shape.

Raised by a family of Bilbies, you can only vaguely recall your real parents. You've always thought that all the other Tassie Tigers died a long time ago. But then the Bunyip Elder found you, and told you that your family is alive, but trapped in the Dreaming. Now hold your horses... don't get upset... you see they're not stuck there forever, if you're up for a bit of an adventure! You see, deep in the Outback, there's this kind of glowy portal thing that is a doorway to the Dreaming. And around that portal there are some carvings in the rock, where five ancient mystical Talismans used to lay. Now, all you have to do is find the five Talismans, put them in the carvings, and the portal to Dreaming will open! Now, before you go off like a frog in a sock, there's just this one SMALL problem. You see there's this evil cassowary - Boss Cass - who's also after the Talismans. Yes. THAT Boss Cass. The one that trapped your family in the Dreaming in the first place, and told the school board to remove all the meat pies from the tuck shops. And if you didn't think that made him enough of a megalomaniac, he's ALSO trapped a whole bunch of your Bilby mates in cages all across the outback... something about overdue library books... Anyways, if you want to open the portal, you'll have to beat him and his henchmen to the Talismans! Don't worry though, you won't be alone!

									",English,NaN,"Animation & Modeling,Design & Illustration,Game Development"," About This Software As an indie game dev you are faced with the challenge of building bigger and richer worlds with smaller teams and limited resources. Houdini Indie’s procedural workflow can help you keep up as you automate repetitive tasks, making it easier to quickly generate larger amounts of high quality content. PROCEDURAL WORKFLOW Houdini Indie provides you with a procedural pipeline-in-a-box where all the steps needed to set up a model or game level are represented by networks of nodes. These nodes can be maintained deep into production, making last minute creative decisions easy. SHAREABLE ASSETS Networks can be wrapped up into Digital Assets which can be loaded into the Unity® or Unreal Engine® game engines using the Houdini Engine plug-ins. There is also Houdini Engine plug-ins for Autodesk® Maya® and Autodesk® 3ds Max.® Your Houdini Indie license will let you work with these plug-ins on your computer while your teammates use the free Houdini Engine Indie to load Houdini Digital Assets into host applications. GAME DEV TOOLS Houdini Indie gives you access to the Game Development Toolset, a collection of over 100 shelf tools and assets designed to speed up game dev workflows. Developed by expert Technical Artists at SideFX, these tools range from managing LOD creation, UV mapping, and texture baking to generating vertex animation textures for a wide range of FX. MODELING Whether you are modeling by hand or working procedurally, Houdini Indie helps you create large models faster than ever before. The modeling tools in Houdini Indie make it easier to create good surface topology for use in games and VR, and can be used interactively in the viewport or procedurally in the Network editor. Choose from a wide variety of polygon, NURBS, and Subdivision Surface modeling tools and use procedural techniques to set up instancing that ensures an efficient deployment of geometry in your game. TERRAINS The terrain system in Houdini Indie lets you layer and edit terrain easily with tools such as procedural noise, heightfields, erosion, and paint and mask out areas directly. The operations are very similar to image compositing, so terrain artists will find the Houdini Indie workflow familiar. VFX From Bullet Rigid Body destruction, to Pyro FX fire and smoke, to sand and snow, to FLIP fluid liquids, Houdini Indie empowers you to create bigger, more explosive visual effects. Using the same tools deployed by top film and game studios, you can simulate a wide range of natural effects. Use the game dev tools to convert simulations into runtime FX for use in-game. LIGHTING, TEXTURING, & RENDERING Houdini Indie’s lighting workflow provides a flexible and powerful environment for managing lights, building shaders, and defining the look of a scene. With Houdini Indie, you can rely on a built-in, physically-based rendering solution called Mantra to render out cinematics or to bake out texture maps from high-res to low-res meshes.
