## CS 225 Data Structures

## Team Contract (dkitten2, pganot2, jmliao2, shackma2)

### Communication
1. Team Meetings: Our team will meet once a week every ___ from __ to __ at __.
We can collaboratively add notes and todos on a Google Document every week to 
point us in the direction for the week. We will designate a different person every week to
draft the weekly DEVELOPMENT LOG entry which will be overlooked by the group. 

2. Assistance: Each team member can be contacted through their Illinois email or
direct message on Discord. Team communication will be done through our group DM
on Discord. We commit to responding to emails and direct message within 2 days. 

3. Respect: Every member must deliver respect to other members during meetings and
other group activities. We will make decisions by simple majority, but we will try
to compromise and meet everyones goals together. We will make sure every member
a chance to speak their opinions about the project. By signing this document, each
member will adhere to the decisions made, even if they personally disagree with them.

### Collaboration
1. Work Distribution: Each week, the neccessary delivarables for the week will be
determined by the whole team and members can volunteer for which one they want. 
As a team, we commit to pushing for fairness in the work load. If one feels otherwise,
they can bring it up in the meeting to change the workload. 

2. Time Commitment: To ensure an equal distribution of work, each member is expected to
independently work no less than 2 hours and no more than 6 hours per week on the project.
If the workload is more than the team will divide up the work fairly. It is the team's 
responsibility, not any individual's responsibility, to make sure a weekly deliverable
is finished by the end of the week. 
However, if a member of the team is constantly ignoring or not finishing deliverables, 
then as a team we will listen to explainations. If understandable, they can deliver more 
work than others on the next week to make up for unfinished work. If behavior is continued,
then further action such as alerting staff members will be taken.

3. Conflict Resolution: All conflicts will try to be resolved by expaining both sides 
to entire group. If conflicts are still not resolved, then the winner will be decided
by coin or dice depending on how many sides their are.
