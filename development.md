## Development

### Week 1
- Brainstorm and get proposal OKed (Everybody)

### Week 2
- Work on CSV parsing (Alex Liao)
- Wrote class of static functions that compare two games and determines if they are "similar" (Donovan)
- Tried writing a dataframe class to parse a csv file and turns it into a map, mapping column names to vector of values (failed) (Donovan)
- Drew up generic BFS, for alteration and use when the search algorithm is needed (Stan)
- Tried to create a general Makefile for the SCC component of the project (PJ)

### Week 3
- Began on Strongly Connected Components code to group together games that are "similar" (PJ)
- Implement correct CSV parsing, including strings and escape characters (Alex Liao)
- Set things up for writing and running tests (Alex Liao)
- Get testing done for similarity (Donovan)
- Get testing done for SCC (PJ)
- Made BFS more specific, updated testing functions. (Stan)

### Week 4
- Updated Graph.cc and Graph.h files to create a getSCC function to retrieve the indices for finding Strongly Connected Components (PJ)
- Wrote force directed drawing class which draws an interpretation of the graph. (Donovan)
- Update BFS to work with main to print recommendations. (Stan)
